        <p>Recently, there have been a lot of news surrounding the name “Spider Man”. First, Sony announced the acquisition of I   n   somniac games, the developer of PS4 exclusive game “Marvel Spider Man”, and then, because of the disagreement between Sony and Disney, the IP of “Spider Man” will be separated from Marvel movie universe. The former hasn’t caused much trouble. After all, insumniac Games has been developing exclusive games for Sony as a third party, while the latter has caused the dissatisfaction of many spider man fans. I hope Sony can allow the “little spider” to stay in MCU.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/8ccb5df3a7114c0e838e775d60c865f9.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Compared with the latter, the former is more concerned by the author. All the players who are concerned about the console game should know that this marvel spider man, although not a masterpiece, has become the best-selling superhero game in the history of the game. Sony’s acquisition is very likely to be ready to serialize this IP. If we can keep the quality of the game and serialize it, it is undoubtedly a good thing for fans. After all, although the IP of spider man is well-known and has numerous derivative game works, there are few masterpieces that can be really remembered by players.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/d062da0443c7485ea516d11275d228e3.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>#Before 2000<br>The original series of Spider Man comics was originally written by the original “Marvel” (later renamed Marvel) company, and it was the first work with teenagers as the main characters. This adolescent high school student named “Peter Parker” had some narcissism and autistic, and this character image aroused the resonance of many young readers, so this character was very popular among young people. We should know that the group of young people is a very large market. If we capture them, we will get the market of many other products. The sales volume of toys, books, clothing and a series of other products will naturally increase. Of course, the electronic games are indispensable.<br>In the 1980s, yadali company started a “video game fever” in Europe and the United States. Almost everyone was fascinated by video games. At this time, if a “Spider Man” game came out in the limelight, it would sell well. Therefore, the first game in the history of “Spider Man” was logged into yadali 2600 platform. The game’s playing method is very simple, just to control a person who looks like Spiderman barely trying to climb a skyscraper to contact the time bomb set by the Green Devils. During the climbing, something will fall in the sky from time to time, and there will be enemies in the window of the building to block the progress of Spiderman. In short, this is an agile game, very boring And the operation is very awkward, people can’t understand.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/4b737b687dfa44039b34f38ade8688b7.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Yadali 2600 spider man<br>Players like spider man so much that they don’t want such a game. Soon after that, Paragon software, a game company, launched a horizontal game called “the amazing spider man and Captain America in Doctor Doom’s Revenge” in the 1990s. In this game Finally, players can control Spiderman to fight against the enemies of the crime blaster. This game is the first horizontal action game in the market of Spiderman series. It not only lays a template for the future game of Spiderman, but also is the leader of other superhero games.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/cc46d968bd334b26ad338a9ce757e03b.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Amiga game “spider man and revenge of the American captain on Dr. doom”<br>#Film wave<br>In 2000, the game has completely entered the 3D era. In this year, Activision company obtained the production copyright of spider man game, and launched the first 3D work “spider man 2000” in the history of spider man, and landed three mainstream game consoles and two mainstream PC platforms at that time. This work was developed by Neversoft studio of Activision. For this reason, developers designed various systems to cope with the unique settings of spider man, such as rope swinging, wall climbing, spider silk launching and all-round three-dimensional combat. This difficult project was handed over to a previous only done “Tony Hawk professional skateboard”, which is a little bit so far. Fortunately, they finished it, but they just didn’t The quality of the game is not so satisfactory. Because it’s a first attempt work, there are always some deficiencies in the concept, and there are also big problems in the operation design of the game, but fortunately, it gives the latter a hint, so that they can know what a 3D spider man should be made.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/8679cbd2262348fdb842d588ffbc8b50.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS spider man 2000<br>In 2002, Sony announced that it would launch a big production real life superhero movie of Spiderman in May, which exploded the whole film and television field. As a pre release warm-up, Activision will launch a game of the same name based on the film template on PS2 platform. Game development and film production are even a little earlier than film production. Therefore, the content of the game must be different from that of the film. After experiencing the lessons of the last time, this time, Activision gave the development of the game to its treyarch studio (representative work “call of Duty: black action”). Based on the previous generation of 3D works, the film is widely used in this work The bridge section and design in are fully consistent with the movie content, but how can the content of a movie support a large-scale game? Therefore, team t has added some bridge sections and characters in the game that only appear in comics.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/20fd8202bf7e4cd68e6b7a59f5d4571c.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS2 spider man: movie version<br>This action game called spider man: the movie was launched half a month before the movie was released. As a warm-up game for a movie, it has a pretty good quality, and the content of the game is worth playing many times. After all, it can directly experience the plot in the movie (although there are differences), and the overall quality is good, but it can not satisfy most people 。 We all know that “Spider Man” starring Toby Maguire has launched three works, which can be called a generation of classics, while the adaptation game has also launched three works. Although each generation is gradually improving in the picture and details, the material and modeling of spider man himself are far superior to other characters in the game, but the quality of the game has always been declining Lu, and even the average score of the game in spider man 3 failed. The reason is that the process of the game is still very short and the content of the game is very scarce, even if there is content other than the movie to supplement, and the price is the same as that of a group of 3A works at that time.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/121fc5d0ddcd4d9b97c469370872bb14.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS3 Spider Man 3<br>#Beyond the shackles<br>In addition to the film adaptation, “Spider Man” this gold medal IP can’t be put on this way naturally, but also should be released from time to time from the film to save the reputation. In the gap between “Spider Man 2” and “Spider Man 3”, Activision has launched a unique work called “ultimate Spider Man”. This work adopts the style of “three shading two”. Whether it’s dialogue, plot or even battle, it’s full of the feeling of comics. What’s more, this work adopts the setting of two protagonists, and sometimes it can operate spider man to do justice, From time to time, the venom, the enemy who can control Spiderman, destroys the game, and there are many hero characters from other Marvel works in the game. The game is very interesting and solid no matter how it is handled or the content of the game. It’s hard for many players to forget after playing it once. As an experimental work, it’s really surprising.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/592d7e2c9e6e44c9a043229ec8823f49.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS2 the ultimate spider man<br>In “the ultimate Spider Man”, Activision has added many bold attempts in the game, such as multi protagonist, open world, new swing and climbing action system. After experiencing the small success of this work, Activision is more confident in later works. Spiderman: the web of shadows in 2008 has the most excellent and powerful open world series so far. Although the plot is a little dark and a little out of the style of Spiderman, this work has been praised by many players and media by accident. Two years later, Spiderman: the dimension of fragmentation is to use a slight caricature style to render the setting of multiple protagonists again to control multiple different times The empty spider man fights in different worlds, and the fighting styles of different characters are quite different, which makes the players fully overcome the addiction of being a superhero. It’s not hard to see that the foundation of “the ultimate Spider Man” for its follow-up works is indeed a great achievement.<br><img src="http://hawishub.com/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man's%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/14d74b6530c84eb887f2445c707d1443.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS3 spider man: the dimension of fragmentation</p>

Even after Sony restart the movie “extraordinary Spider Man” and let Activision make the adapted game. Although it has achieved unprecedented cheerfulness in terms of screen, expression and fluency, it is still full of the consistent characteristics of the adapted game: sacrifice content to cater to the movie. And the sequel “time and space edge” of “broken dimension” a year later has also been criticized by the players for its lack of sincerity, just like a skin changing game with poor quality. In this way, we didn’t see the completely new marvel spider man until 2018. Although it’s still a classic formula of open world plus linear tasks, it’s definitely the best superhero work in recent years in terms of game experience and performance. As for this IP, it seems that it is also in Sony’s hands. As for the future performance of this series, please wait and see.</p>
