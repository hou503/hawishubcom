In the late 1980s, it was the era of arcades and home games. When talking about the game works of that period, many post-90s or post-80s would mention classic works such as Super Mario and Douro. At that time, except Nintendo, Konami was the most popular company. "Red fortress", "green Legion" and just mentioned "soul battle" and many other excellent works of war themes are all from the hands of kolomei, and become irreplaceable classics in the minds of players.

After more than 30 years, today's cologne has long been different from the scenery of that time, but "the battle of souls" has lived to the present with the changes of the times. At the E3 game exhibition held in June this year, Cologne released the latest work of "soul fighter" series, RC alliance, and announced that it would be released in just three months. Many people are excited just to see the name of "soul duel" and say they must pay for it. But no one expected that this orthodox sequel, which was personally operated by "father of soul duel", might have become one of the worst works of this generation.

# wrong board?  
Take the PS4 platform as an example. So far, there are 20 media that have scored for "soul fighter: RC League", while only one media has given a positive score. The others either linger on the passing line or fail completely. What's worth mentioning is that most of the media that give the evaluation for the game are self-supporting small media, few of which are internationally renowned media. Among them, ign has the highest status, but they only give a four point (10 out of 10) evaluation for the game, and they say that this is the worst work in the history of soul duel series. In the view of IGN, if Cologne doesn't name the game "soul duel", no one will think it's a "soul duel" game. It's enough to disappoint every fan who loves this series. He abandoned the most iconic play method of "soul duel", but failed to achieve its original production height or even worse. There's no doubt that Cologne Le Mei wasted a chance to polish the golden signboard of "the battle of souls".

In "RC alliance", the biggest change is that the game style has changed from the original horizontal action shooting to the 3D action shooting of the overlooking angle, but it is not always the overlooking angle, and there is often a switch between the perspective of crossing the shoulder and the perspective of chasing the back, which can not be controlled by the players completely, and the game itself will make the change according to the progress of the checkpoint Adjustment. The biggest drawback of this design is that the perspective does not change with the player's consciousness. It is very easy to confuse the player, and sometimes it is blocked by the objects in the scene, which greatly affects the play. Players who have played the old version should know that one of the core contents of the previous game is to avoid the enemy's attack, so jumping and crawling are two very important operations. In this work, a new "dodge" action without consumption and cooling is added, which can not only dodge the attack, but also stun the enemy, which makes the jumping action completely unavailable except for crossing obstacles Purpose. For the first time, the image quality and character setting of the game are slightly behind the times. It's not like a 2019 shooting game at all.

Reform of       
In the memory of many players, it is estimated that the most impressive one is the first generation of "soul Douluo" and the sequel "super soul Douluo" (also known as "soul Douluo 2") on the red and white computer in the early years. In fact, in the next many years, "soul Douluo" has been trying to push out new works, and has tried to launch a 3-D perspective shooting before long, but since PC After the rise of the game market, except for some series fans, there are not many players who only log in to the console and the handheld platform. However, although the popularity of this series has gradually declined, the new work has been persistently launched, and even the mobile game "soul fighter: back", which was launched in cooperation with Tencent later, although it reveals a crude atmosphere from its bones, the popularity is still obvious. This gives keleme confidence, and it's just that other manufacturers are also launching a collection of classic games of various duplicating versions. It seems that it's a trend to show the old IP in the industry.

"The father of the battle of souls"
In fact, as a work adapted from the sci-fi film alien, the series has a high popularity in Europe and the United States in view of the influence of the film. To a large extent, it is not only because of the high quality of the game itself, but also because it complements the film. And in Asia, even if everyone knows the name of "Doula", but not many people hold the authentic game card tape, let alone who knows what kind of story "Doula" tells. These players only know that the game is fun to play, and it's better to cooperate online with small partners. Coleman also knows how many sales of these works it owns, and always hopes to have a chance to develop the market in Asia. However, due to the bad review of "soul fighter: back", the IP reputation has declined. At this year's Dongjing video game exhibition, the participating Coleman uses a quarter of its own area to publicize "RC alliance" Biography, it can be seen that Cologne attaches great importance to this work, but perhaps they didn't expect that the current players no longer eat their original set.

Keleme is very familiar with current affairs and has added many new elements to RC alliance, such as multiple optional roles, weapon configuration and accessories selection, upgrading from two person online to online four person online, and even 4v4 PVP content. The overall game style is still the familiar B-movie style of the 1990s, but the times are changing, and people's tastes and aesthetics are also changing, because of the design theory The stereotype of reading makes it difficult for this game to enter the stage of elegance at present. If it is not true love fans, even in other fields, this style is no longer popular.

    concluding remarks  
The reason why the "soul fighting" in the early years can become a classic in the minds of millions of people is that it is simple and direct, playing addictive, and online with friends more tests the cooperation ability of two people, even if it is "mutual harm" is also fun. For an IP that has been more than 30 years old, it's really difficult to get a place in this efficient fast food era. If you can't follow the rules and regulations to ensure that the original game experience pays homage to the classic, you can only choose to keep up with the times for a long time, and use the design and production of the latest trend to get the recognition of the players. But maybe even if this generation of "RC League" is reviled, there are still some players who will enjoy it. Don't think it's because they don't know how to appreciate it. Maybe it's just because there is a little content in the game that brings them the fun they want.
