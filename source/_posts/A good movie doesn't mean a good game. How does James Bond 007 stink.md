There are three famous secret agents in the game world, one is the strongest mercenary "snake" from the "alloy equipment" series, the other is Sam Fisher from the "cell division" series, and the last one is Agent 47 (Agent 47) from the "killer" series. The three agents had been fighting each other in the past years, but now they have already gone their separate ways. The sequels of alloy equipment and cell division have become the lifetimes, while killer has chosen a different path from the former. As we all know, the "four kings" always have five people, and the three agents must have a "fourth person", and the fourth monologue fame is certainly better than the former, but as for the game works, it's hard to say.

He is handsome and dignified. His black suit and silencing pistol are his symbols. He is vigorous and has outstanding shooting skills. He holds all kinds of novel equipment to play the enemy between the hands and the thighs. He is not only an excellent agent, but also a charming gentleman. He is always accompanied by beautiful women. Some people may say, "are you sure you didn't introduce 47 again?" Of course not. He's British agent James Bond, and if you're not familiar with the name, he has a more widely known code name 007.

#  "my name is bond, James Bond"
007 series is a series of espionage novels written by Ian Lancaster Fleming, a British spy in the former World War II. Out of fear of marriage life, he created this work based on his own prototype. The first work of 007, Casino Royale, was published in 1953. Because of its novel and wonderful story, it soon became a success. Many of the black technology equipment in the story have prototypes in reality. The protagonist's name "James Bond" comes from the author of a book called birds of the West Indies, and the character's design is completely based on Ian's own life experience and preferences. This mysterious agent called "perfect type man" has enough charm to make all men jealous and all women crazy. With the great sale of the novel, the image of "007" began to be known by more and more people.

Ian Fleming, father of 007
The story of 007 is excellent enough to make a wonderful movie. In 1962, the first film of 007 series, Dr. no, was released and became popular all over the world, and the name of James Bond became more and more popular. Unfortunately, two years after the movie was released, Ian Fleming, the original author, died of a heart attack. In his lifetime, he completed the last 007 work "the golden gun man", but the 007 series did not end his story. Later, John Gardner (who has died) and Raymond Benson took over the writing of subsequent works and screenplays. Up to now, there are 14 novels in 007 series, and 26 films (two autobiographies). And next year, its 25th orthodox work bond 25 will be ushered in, which can be said to be a classic legend that really accompanies a generation.

James Bond of all ages
# hard won glory
Sports cars, beauties, black technology equipment and perfect men's secret agents are all used to stir up the men's hormones. Just ask which man doesn't want to be a "successful man" like James Bond. Based on this idea, the adapted play of 007 series is run to try to satisfy the little wish of the male audience. Coincidentally, "007" series is about to usher in his 25th work, and "007" series adaptation game is also a good 25. The first work of the series is James Bond 007, a horizontal shooting game that landed on yadali 2600 platform in 1983. However, the quality of the game is not satisfactory. Can you imagine a 007 game with the full name of James Bond not appearing except for the start screen? As a result, the game did not cause as much sensation as the movie or novel, and the sales volume was also very poor.

James Bond 007 game screen, not to say who knows this is 007 game
What is puzzling is that 007 is so easy to make into the theme of the game, but it has not been able to produce a satisfactory work. The works over the years are either of poor quality or quite different from the story of 007. In this way, it has come to the age of 3D games. Nintendo launched its own sub era console N64. At first, the British developer rare planned to make a 2D horizontal scroll game 007 for the N64. At that time, when the movie golden eye was in full swing, it is not surprising that the idea of a game came out. Later, at the suggestion of game development director Martin Hollis, they redesigned golden eye into an FPS game to fully adapt to the features and functions of N64. To put it in normal times, people will certainly take it for granted that this is another adaptation game, but this time, rare's unusual intention for this adaptation game.

N64 golden eye cover
According to the characteristics of N64, rare specially designed a set of FPS operation mode belonging to the handle, and for the first time introduced the stealth and part injury (i.e. head burst or kick) system in the FPS game, making the game experience more like controlling an agent than a man with developed limbs and simple mind. A large number of scenes in the movie are restored in the game, and the game has a more sense of substitution under the support of FPS. In order to achieve this effect, the development team also specially went to the shooting set of golden eye to collect a large number of materials. The birth of 007 golden eye has changed people's cognition of FPS game, breaking the magic spell of "host platform is FPS forbidden area", and the media have made high marks for it. The sales volume of the game in the United States alone has soared 5 million sets, and up to now, it has sold more than 8 million sets. As a 007 game, it has finally become a milestone in FPS history Monumental work.

"Golden eye" game screen, in 1997 has been quite excellent
#  "agent" is gone forever
However, the rise of the handsome agent in the game world seems to be over. After the explosion of 007 golden eye, the American manufacturer EA felt that the IP was profitable and paid a lot of money to buy all the production rights and distribution rights of the subsequent 007 games from MGM film company. At that time, EA was still in the exploration stage of game adaptation. Although it tried its best to rely on the golden eye and try to restore the plot and scene of the game, it still had more than enough effort in the design of system and operation. Two successive works suffered sudden death, once making 007, the IP, return to the posture before golden eye. EA thinks that if it goes on like this, IP adaptation will inevitably be limited in production, which will affect the consistency and experience of the game to a large extent. Therefore, EA plans not to use the original plot to make adaptation games, but to create original game works based on basic settings.

007: after tomorrow
The follow-up works 007: agent of the line of fire and 007: night fire have improved in all aspects after breaking away from the shackles of the movie plot, and the evaluation of the game has gradually recovered, while the later released 007: who is competing with the leader is the masterpiece of this IP in the hands of EA, regardless of whether it is the best in the plot or in the performance of music and painting, and this work should also be James Bond's actor, Pierce Brosnan, made his last appearance in the game.
Later, due to EA's own reasons, MGM took back the IP of 007 and gave it to Activision. In the eyes of Activision at that time, its call of duty (COD) series was almost equal to the shooting games of that period. When Activision got the IP of 007, it also made adaptation games like cod. But unlike cod, the game's brilliance and game experience were far inferior to cod series, and its playing method was cod series series Like linear level and script performance.

Who will fight for the front is another kind of magnificent ending of Bruce South
Activision has successively launched three works for the 007 series, and the protagonist has been replaced by the current 007 actor Daniel Craig. First, 007: quantum crisis, which spans two movie scenarios, was criticized because it is too similar to and far inferior to the COD series. However, the subsequent 007: Bloodstone has become a third person stealth The game, however, does not have the feeling that 007 is an agent or a spy. It is said that 007 is not of the right bloodline. Later, on the 50th anniversary of 007 series, 007: Legend, which spans six movie plots, was launched at one go. However, although it is playing the emotion card, all 007 is played by Daniel alone. In addition to the plot of the biggest selling point, the whole game It's all about cod.
Before that, you didn't think quantum crisis is like cod, but it's not as good as cod. This time, just make cod directly. What do you say? It's true that this memorable work is also remembered by people, but it's just rotten. The average score of the media is only 26 (full score of 100).

007: Legend game screen, are you sure this is not cod6?
    concluding remarks  
Since then, the author has never seen the 007 series of game works. Activision even took the three works they had sold off the platform, as if it wanted to erase the traces of these games. However, the death of the game did not affect the popularity of the movie and bond's status in the hearts of fans. After all, Activision is not race. Their main purpose of playing games is to earn money, while race is to make games with the attitude of wanting to be recognized by the players, and the final outcome of the two is obvious, a famous history, a legacy. The story of bond fighting in the game circle has come to an end for a while. It is also unknown whether there will be any new works in the future. But it is undeniable that the era of bond seems to be really coming to an end. I hope that it can draw a perfect sentence for us at the end of life.
