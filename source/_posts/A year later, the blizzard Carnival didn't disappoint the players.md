In view of the embarrassment of last year's Carnival, many players once thought blizzard, a game company, was just like a fighter who couldn't help himself, unwilling to become a miser in the mobile game market. "Don't you have a cell phone?" It's full of players' satire and disappointment about Blizzard, and Blizzard seems to realize how embarrassing they were last year, so after holding for a whole year, they finally ushered in a wave of outbursts.

In the early morning of November 2, countless Blizzard fans waited in front of the computer for the start of the conference, and the whole opening ceremony was almost full of dry goods, the most important of which was "Diablo 4" and "watch pioneer 2". World of Warcraft was about to usher in the new 9.0 version, and "Legend of furnace stone" finally planned to add a new game mode. One after another heavy bombs hit the players. It seemed that they were a little excited to faint for a while. Everything was announced to the world: "Blizzard is back.".

# back to the dark
As the saying goes, "ten years for games, nine years for CG", which is used to describe Blizzard is the most appropriate, and in this blizzard carnival, Blizzard did not waste this talent, as always began to broadcast. As the lights of the venue changed to bright red, the screen became more and more bright, and the huge logo appeared on the screen, which is the "Diablo 4" that players are looking forward to for many years. In fact, from a long time ago, the rumor that Diablo will launch the fourth generation of works has never stopped. As early as late last year, Kotaku, a foreign media, reported that Blizzard would release the news of Diablo 4 at the 2018 carnival, but because the official is not ready, the plan was cancelled at the last moment.
The incident was later denied by Blizzard officials, who said they did prepare a section to show the content of Diablo 4, which is still under development, but they did not decide to release it at this carnival. What we saw this year may be what the news said "the prepared content".

Diablo 4 leaked from the introduction of art set
According to the official, the story of Diablo 4 takes place in the future several years after various events in Diablo 3. Lilith, the daughter of Mephisto, the ancestor of human beings, began to extend her evil claw to St. hueari. He inspired the deepest evil in all people's hearts and made the whole world fall into chaos and despair again. It is worth mentioning that this time, Diablo 4 will adopt a seamless open world map architecture, and for the first time provide a mount for players to use. Players can explore freely in this huge world, and can take risks in different areas in any order, which means that this work will use non-linear narrative for the first time.
Compared with "Diablo 3", the screen of this work has been greatly improved compared with the previous work, and this work will become the first realistic game work in blizzard history, and allow players to customize their role image. From the existing information, this work is undoubtedly the biggest change in the whole series. I don't know whether these new things can meet the needs of players.

"Diablo 4" game reality screen
# Legend Continues
"Watch the vanguard" can be said to be the youngest independent IP in Blizzard's hands. It still has a very high popularity since it was launched. Although this game does not have a very high popularity in China, it is largely because of the acclimatization. This game has been mixed up in foreign countries, and has become another trump card work in Blizzard's hands. "Watch pioneer 2" came on stage as the finale at the opening ceremony of this carnival. Also, some information of the game had been leaked at a very early time. It said that "watch 2" would be a game focusing on PVE versus war, and a large number of FPS materials derived from "StarCraft" that had been cancelled were used. In fact, Blizzard confirmed this point when it officially released "watch 2". It said that the PVE mode of four people cooperation in "watch 2" was to cater to the long-term petitions of the players, and what they always wanted to do. It opened a new chapter for this legendary science fiction hero story.

The hero lineup is now open
Because the game scale of PVE is much larger than the simple 6v6 competition mode, the upgraded engine is used in watch 2, which is more abundant in map scene scale, special effects and details. This does not mean that "watch 2" is a pure PVE game, and the traditional 6v6 multi player competition will also be added to the game, and the players who play "watch 2" can compete with the players who have the previous works in the same world, the former players can also experience the new roles and maps, and the data and achievements between the two can be fully interconnected.
Strictly speaking, "watch pioneer 2" is more like a previous "2.0 version update", which can be explained by the fact that the two games can communicate with each other, and it has been exposed that the two games will be merged into the same client in the future, while the players who do not purchase "watch pioneer 2" cannot play PVE mode, which is similar to "Fortress night" produced by epic ã€‹Especially.

# classic continuation
In addition to these two heavy bombs, Blizzard's other games also have many "small moves". After a series of controversies about the plot, world of Warcraft finally ushered in version 9.0. After burning the world tree and giving up the tribe to leave without permission, our queen Sylvanas ran to the frozen throne again and directly pouted the Lich King's helmet, breaking the gap between the dead world and Azeroth and causing a series of events. As players, I We will face the events created by the Greek queen in person.

The boundary between the two worlds is broken
After the self-propelled game of "Dao TA self-propelled chess", "Dao TA Baye" and "the game of cloud top", Blizzard finally joined the new round of "self-propelled chess battle" and launched the "pub war chess" mode for its card game "Legend of furnace stone". Although the design and rules are different from the general self-propelled chess, the overall design is different from self-propelled chess Chess is the same, but whether Blizzard can survive in the new round of battle to the end depends on whether they can realize their unique ideas.

Don't control the battle by yourself
    concluding remarks  
Although the content released at the carnival is full of weight, so that players can feel that Blizzard they once loved is finally back. This time, they didn't play emotion cards, and everything is new content, but it's more or less likely to be a bit of a hot follower. It seems that the number one card at this conference must be "Diablo 4", which finally let the players put their hearts down. However, the quality of the game should not be commented until the game is officially launched. It's a little helpless to watch players change from violent white to violent black, and the time of the night turns back to violent white. However, I believe that players have not enjoyed such exciting feeling for a long time.
