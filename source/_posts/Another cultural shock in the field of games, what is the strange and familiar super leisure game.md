I vaguely remember that at the beginning of last year, almost everyone around me was addicted to a small game called "jump and jump". Since then, all kinds of small games like "jump and jump" have sprung up. Although the playing methods of these games are different, they are almost the same in the game experience. People's ability to accept these games is far greater than the sense of exclusion. Therefore, no matter what kind of games they are, they can quickly get a batch of support in a short time.

Up to now, quite a few people are still playing these games. The players don't know what these games are. They just know that these games are fun, addictive and don't need to download different fees. With the increasing number of players, the game manufacturers begin to pay attention to this type. In order to facilitate communication, the industry has reached a consensus that the same kind of game is called "super leisure game".
# "Minimalism" in all aspects
To explain it in a popular way, the so-called super leisure games are not much different from arcade games in terms of playing methods and modes. It depends on how long you can stick to your life and get high scores as much as possible. The playing methods and rules of these games are usually easy to understand and use. At the same time, they don't need additional download and installation. They can be opened and played anytime and anywhere, making full use of players' fragmented time.
The origin of super leisure games can be traced back to the era of "national Nokia". Basically, there will be a "greedy snake" or other leisure games in mobile phones. These games were first launched on the arcade platform in the early years, and then transplanted to the mobile platform. These games fully retain the characteristics of arcade games. How long a life can last depends on personal technology and consciousness, and it is very thrilling and exciting to play. Even if the game picture is very simple, it still has endless fun. Later, with the rise of smart phones, the quality of games has been improved. Many manufacturers are committed to restoring the game experience of the host platform on the mobile platform, but there are also some stores that insist on making lightweight leisure games.

Let's try to recall what are the most representative mobile games in the early days of the rise of smart phones? Such as "Temple Escape", "fruit ninja", "graffiti jump" and so on have been very popular for a while, which have left a deep impression on the players. In short, this type of game exists in the same way, and has been thinking for quite some time, but it has not been recognized by the public, knowing to enter the mobile game market, combined with the unique characteristics of the mobile platform, which can be valued by people.
Nowadays, making a super leisure game needs three features: simple, intuitive, interesting and addictive playing method; simple and eye-catching painting style, small size and even no download; no payment and no internal purchase, and revenue through the game's built-in advertising. The integration finally converges into two words: simplicity. In a word, everything that can be contracted should be simple, even the addictive way is also very simple.

What kinds of games are popular in the mobile game market now? I don't believe I need to elaborate too much here. Most of the extremely popular mobile games are competitive types of "fighting with people", or card RPG games that require players to invest their time and energy for a long time. These games are called "heavy Games" no matter how fast the rhythm is or how "liver degree" is. Their purpose is to keep players for a long time to create stable income. The profit mechanism of these games is even more mature than many end games, so they can maintain long-term vitality.
After all, not everyone likes to play these kinds of games. Nowadays, with the acceleration of the pace of life, most of the players will not invest too much time and energy in the game, but what follows is that the frequency of people's "fragment time" is much higher than before, obviously using this Limited fragment time to "eat a chicken" or a plate of "glory of the king", obviously It's not very realistic, so players have the demand for "leisure". It can be said that the success of super leisure games is expected by many manufacturers.

Don't underestimate the coverage of leisure games. Although it seems that the topic and flow generated by these leisure games are far less than those of popular competitive games, the audience groups of leisure games are not as limited as those of video games. If the focus groups of popular games are "players", then the audience groups of these super leisure games are each one Smartphone users, this group includes players and people outside the players, some just to pass the time, some just for fun, so the coverage of leisure games is even higher than those popular games.
These lightweight games have a short development cycle and low cost, and the revenue that can be created for them can easily achieve considerable results. Therefore, they begin to prevail in the game industry gradually, and more and more people participate in it to develop this fertile land. And its real "tipping point" is the beginning of 2018.

#Short life
In the past year, super leisure games have developed rapidly at an unprecedented speed. Many super leisure game manufacturers' annual revenue is about 2-2.5 billion US dollars. Looking at the domestic mobile game rankings, most of them are the "heavy game" just mentioned by the author. In the overseas market, several works occupying the rankings for a long time come from four companies: France and France Under the influence of China's Voodoo, Ubisoft's affiliated katchapp, UK's kwalee and rising star lion studio, it's better to say that those "tough characters" who can break into the top ten are the rarest ones.
As I mentioned above, these games are usually free of charge and no internal purchase. They guide the players through built-in ads to make profits. In short, the purpose of these games is to promote other games. Therefore, the length of the life of these games depends on whether the advertisers can master the use of leisure games to promote themselves. After all, there are games on one side and there are games on the other People, once combined, can make profits.

After all, the size of such a game is not large, so its playability is very limited. Usually, the heat of a super leisure game will soon disappear, even those heavy game players will feel tired after a long time, not to mention the poor playability of leisure games. However, super leisure games can make use of different game works to make users stay in their own games for a long time through creative realization. After all, the profit of the game is not directly proportional to the cost, and the cost paid by the developers is far lower than their income, so that the developers can discard the lost enthusiasm works and start to develop new works without any pain. It solves the problem of user number and revenue, and then another problem emerges: since the number of users of super leisure games is so large, what impact will it have on the whole game industry?

#Conclusion
In my opinion, super leisure games have undoubtedly injected a lot of fresh blood into the game market. After all, the lower limit of its audience is very low and the upper limit is very high. More people swarming into this field means that it can bring revenue to the game industry, and the revenue can stimulate more people to join in the game development industry. With them, there will be new games, and new games can be promoted It is undoubtedly a virtuous circle for new players to generate more revenue. The low threshold of super leisure game makes more people who have not been exposed to the game participate in the attempt. It can be said that it is the most suitable existence for a "user" to become a "player", which can be said that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

Crowded city
But it's hard to say whether there will be profit driven companies in the future. Once a good game environment is connected with capital, it will easily become a mess. Fortunately, at least it hasn't appeared at this stage. Super leisure has undoubtedly brought an impact to the whole game industry. It is already an existence that cannot be underestimated, and it will continue to develop in the future. As for what level it will rise to in the future, please wait and see.
