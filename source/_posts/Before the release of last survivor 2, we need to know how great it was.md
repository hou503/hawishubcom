In order to survive, he can do whatever he wants. It's easy to kill people and surpass goods. In the past 20 years, the whole country has become lifeless, and the government only governs the people in a relatively tough way at the lowest level.

The second leading role: Allie
"The last survivor" is essentially an action adventure game with survival elements. There are other survivors and "zombies" infected by fungi everywhere on the way. What the players have to do is to find ways to survive in various scenarios and go to the destination smoothly. As a linear game, the playability of this work can not be said to be very high, but because of this very immersive plot and scene design, as well as the vivid characterization, the whole process of the game has a tense atmosphere at all times. Every battle requires the players to be careful. How to manage the materials, props and even ammunition is the key to the game. This is not the first time for naughty dogs to try the game works set by two protagonists. In the past "mysterious sea area", although the player has been controlling the protagonist Nathan Drake, there is always a good partner who can pull you at a critical moment. This design has been used since the early generation of "mysterious sea area", and in "the last survivor", this setting is not only The key of the game process is the direction of the plot.

In this work, naughty dogs try their best to create a sense of immersion with a high degree of simulation, so many settings and designs are drawn from the real world, even the outbreak of infectious Cordyceps fungus is a real species in reality. On this long road, the change of mood between Joel and Ellie and the emotional transformation between them are the most striking places in this work. Along the way, two people have encountered various difficulties and dangers, chatted and quarreled with each other, from the cold talk to becoming an integral part of their lives. Joel needs a person to appear to save the lost daughter Pain, and the loss of her family since childhood, Allie also needs a person to stand up to guide her in the direction of the future. In this journey, the two people gradually form an interdependent relationship, and perhaps this emotion can only be fully highlighted in a desperate situation, let alone in a world full of despair. From this point of view, both the background and the human settings in the game are almost integrated in a very ingenious way. The plot, human settings and the background form a complementary relationship, which will not only not create a sense of play for the players, but also further deepen the sense of story substitution.

Allie, who always follows Joel, is more like a living existence than an AI. Her impression on the players is no less than that of Elizabeth in biochemist: infinite. Every player who has played "the last survivor" is moved by his touching plot, which is actually one of the models of "the ninth art". Unfortunately, this work failed to win the best of the year, so his opponent is too strong (gta5). It's getting closer and closer to the release date of last survivor 2. What kind of emotion can naughty dogs bring to us this time.
