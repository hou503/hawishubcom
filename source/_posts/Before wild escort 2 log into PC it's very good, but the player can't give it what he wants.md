On October 4, 2019, Rockstar officially announced that its latest 3A masterpiece, the great escort in the wilderness: Redemption 2, will log into the PC platform on November 5.
This news is not long, but it makes the whole game circle boil. It has been a year since the game was released, but it seems that the discussion heat of the game in China only existed for a period of time when it was first launched, and the period when the online mode "wilderness escort ol" was officially launched. After that, the attention and topic of the game in China almost fell to the freezing point, and even the content update of the major version was rarely discussed The biggest reason is that there is no PC in this game.

This time, the news that the game is about to land on PC is undoubtedly a good thing for the domestic players, which means that the game may have a high exposure and attention in China like gta5, and for those who really like the game, it must be a mixed story to know the news: to be able to see the game they like It's a good thing to get more players' attention. At the same time, "wild escort 2" as a landmark work of the open world in the industry, can also make more players once the style of this game. However, in view of the unique nature of the game itself, it is bound to cause a new round of controversy among the players again, and the focus of the controversy will be the platitude of "gameplay".

#What's good about it?  
People who often watch overseas entertainment programs should know that in the impression of foreigners, when referring to the film and television related works of Western themes, they always refer to such representative classic works as "guanshanfeidu", "tiger and leopard little overlord", "golden three escort" and so on. Compared with the domestic fascinating martial arts children and girls in the Jianghu, I prefer these simple but elegant works Old legends that can be deeply rooted in people's hearts. A cigarette, a pot of wine, a revolver, riding a steed on the sunset plain, watching the steam train flying across the horizon in the distance, maybe this is the unique romance of those rough and unrestrained tough guys. Although these stories are wonderful, they are not our own stories after all. Therefore, many Chinese people do not have too many emotional elements for these works. In addition, the western theme works are few in the current film and television field, which doomed the minority of this theme in China.

The protagonist's shape in the three golden escort should be the most popular
Western theme games have been on the market all the time, from action shooting to simulation management and so on, but they are gradually buried by history as western movies. If it wasn't r star's "the big escort in the wilderness", people's attention to this theme might have been gone for a long time. In short, if you don't have a passion for this theme, you won't be interested in these games, even if the developer is r star.

The name R-star represents the highest development power of the whole game industry. Each generation of works can be regarded as an industry milestone in concept design and technical ability. And this generation of "big escort in the wilderness: Redemption 2" enables R-star to unite studios all over the world to develop even beyond the scale and treatment of "gta5". Therefore, this work is not only in the picture performance but also in the game Capacity design is the strongest in this generation. At the same time, the game also has a very wonderful plot. R star always takes "to create a world for telling a story" as the concept, this time is no exception. Throughout the history of R star's game, it seems that their stories are just like those of Stephen Chow's films, with a small character as the protagonist, telling a story that is not painful to others, but not painful to themselves There is no absolute heroism in a significant experience, and there will never be so-called peace in the world.

R star has always been an unprecedented obsession with the details of the game. No matter the modeling and animation performance of the character or the series of special effects in the scene have reached the abnormal level. For example, the skin and muscle activities of the character and the bulging blood vessels can be seen clearly. Each interaction has script animation effect, or the raindrops under the eaves of the rainy house can even swing with the wind.
R star aims to create a near real western world to enhance the immersion of the game. Because everything in the game is so reasonable, players will feel a sense of "all phenomena in the game are reasonable". Most of the time, players will think in combination with their common sense of life when they make actions, such as eating when they are hungry, Cold to add clothes, horse dirty to brush hair, do not pay attention to personal hygiene will be other NPC away and so on. This kind of thinking mode of the player is combined with the strong picture expressive force of the game, thus forming the "immersion sense" in the player's impression, so as to achieve the desired game effect of R star.

To sum up, R star has made great efforts in shaping the "reality" of the western world and achieved the effect they have always wanted to achieve, and the biggest advantage of this game has just become the disadvantage of this game. Because the game has almost reached the abnormal level for the restoration of reality, its process is also very lengthy and complex in the actual play process. Take shopping in the store as an example, you can directly select the goods you need on the shelf and directly put them in your pocket to pay for people to leave, or you can go to the counter to browse the catalog of goods to choose. The specific process of the latter is: go to the counter , talk to the boss about the catalog, open the catalog, turn to the section you want to see, pay for the goods, close the book and return it to the boss, and leave the store. In reality, it's almost the same process to order a dish in the restaurant, but the game has done every step of the operation, which makes the process of shopping in the game become very slow and complex. Some people may say that the way of shopping is very cool and delicate, but more people will say "why is it so troublesome to buy something?".

There are many other designs like this in the game, and this is also the biggest pain point of the game. Some people say that this game is a "cowboy Simulator". Everything is good but not fun. Maybe in R star's view, they think so, but it's just what they want. They don't care whether the player can be a wild man in the western world like in Los Angeles. They don't care whether the game can be recognized by the vast majority of players. They just want to fulfill their expectations. The relationship with the word "Simulator" means that the game is destined to become a minority work again. After all, only a small number of people like to seek the truth in the game, but unlike other "simulators", the "wild escort 2" is a top 3A work completely, and has a strong artistic flavor.

If you simply like R star's style of action, development philosophy and players interested in Western themes, you may like this work very much and get the best game experience in the same theme game. As for the players who simply follow the trend, or who want to be a savage in the western world because they like GTA, they may feel disappointed after buying it and run to the community to scold the spicy chicken game. I don't know why other people give this game a very high evaluation. Ironically, the players who belong to the latter in China may occupy the majority of the shares Well, there will be disputes between the two players. This is the current environment. Fast pace is simple and directly the mainstream. The famous slow pace and authenticity of "wild escort 2" is doomed not to be criticized by the mainstream groups, let alone a few true love fans to easily change this situation.

    concluding remarks  
In the understanding of many domestic players, it seems that many of the first-line 3A masterpieces will die suddenly if they don't get on the PC. this time, the "wild escort 2" will log on to the PC because of its low popularity. It's necessary to make some money by copying another wave of enthusiasm on the PC. In fact, this is a big misunderstanding. The real reason is that the players' petition for the PC is too loud, and R star does not want to live up to the expectations of these players this time. After all, the previous generation of works has not launched the PC version until today, but still does not affect the game has a very hot sales and high evaluation.

The previous generation's work "the great escort in the wilderness: Redemption"
For "wild escort 2", I'm very glad that R star still devoted himself to creating the real virtual world after tasting the sweetness in gta5. After all, the two games are quite different in style. If we add too many entertainment elements similar to those in GTA to "wild escort", we will lose the original flavor of this theme. Although it's a controversial work, it's worth every player who loves the game to try. This time, the login PC also gives a green light to more players. The rest can only hope that this work can dominate the hot sales list like gta5 all the year round.
