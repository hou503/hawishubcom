18 years ago, China's online games rose abruptly. Many games witnessed the changes of China's game industry and left many happy memories for many players. In the long history of China's online games, there are many games that have to decline because of many other factors, which is closely related to the emergence of plug-in, but today's protagonist is not plug-in, but even more vicious than plug-in, that is private server. Up to now, we can see all kinds of private servers of the old game on various web pages, so in the end, what is the private server? Why are so many people willing to play? Why do private servers exist more vicious than plug-ins?
#The rise of private service
It is well known that there has always been a cracked piracy in single player games, and the private server is the "piracy" of online games. The private server is the network server that the individual obtains the server installation program and builds without authorization. Its purpose is to divide the game players and make profits from it.
Because it's a personal server, most systems of the game can be modified artificially, which meets the needs that many official game servers can't meet. For example, if you fill hundreds of pieces in a game, you may just start a low-level VIP, while in the private server, you may have been a high-level member since you started online. Some private servers do not choose to open to the outside world or make profits. Such servers are generally small in scale. They are only assumed in the Internet bar for the purpose of entertainment. It reduces the consumption cost of the game and enjoys better game experience, so private server can attract so many players.

These "+ 999" and "one knife 999" are also derived from private service
Whether it is profitable or not, the existence of private server means that the revenue and flow of official server will be greatly affected, and the market retention rate of game is also very problematic, which is illegal in any case. In the first generation of online games, the most representative work is "Internet creation century" (hereinafter referred to as UO), which is also the first work to appear in the Chinese game market. However, few people know that the game entered the Chinese game market not through the agent operation of Internet manufacturers, but through private services.
At that time, the R & D technology of online games was limited, and players who knew a little about the program could tamper with the game code around the world. At that time, no manufacturer in the Chinese market realized that they could make profits through online games. In other words, it was because of the emergence of private online games that manufacturers began to pay attention to the online game industry, but also It is because of the private service that the online game environment at that time was so smoky.

The most difficult problem is the language setting of Internet creation
# full explosion
In 2000, the king of kings, which originated from Taiwan, entered the mainland of China and became the first graphic online game in the history of Chinese online games and achieved great success. Taking this opportunity, a series of works, such as legend, miracle, Three Kingdoms on the Internet and so on, successively appeared on the market, raising the online games of China to an unprecedented height. At that time, the mainstream online games basically adopted the charging system of point card and monthly card. At that time, not everyone had the conditions to put some money into the game with the consumption level at that time, so to a large extent, many shy young people and student players were dissuaded. They were eager to have free games and could only be addicted through game magazines or TV programs The kind of player is not in the minority, but also is to see this point, then appeared above in the Internet bar, not for the purpose of profit-making private server.

Although it seems that the picture of king of Kings is simple now, it carried the memories of countless people at that time
In the middle of 2002, the Italian server program of legendary, a classic online game from South Korea, was accidentally leaked. After entering China, the private service of legendary spread at an explosive speed. In less than half a year, about 500 private services could be found on the market to operate at the same time. These private servers have low charges, high explosion rate and fast upgrade, and are favored by players who fail to get a good experience in the official server.
Private server absorbed the water of the players in the official uniform of legend. The most uncomfortable one was Shanda network, which was responsible for the agency work in China. The players were seriously separated, and Shanda could only stand on one side and was helpless. Later, Shanda also tore his face. He refused to pay the share of the game on the ground that the Korean developers could not solve the technical problems, and ran away with the money he earned. Therefore, legend declined, and the company relationship between China and South Korea was completely broken.

Nowadays, the private servers of legend are mainly page tours
Taking this incident as an opportunity, many people have taken a fancy to the revenue capacity of private service, so there is such a gray industry chain in the places outside the law. There are special people who are responsible for stealing the service end or source code of the game. If they can't steal it, they will edit it by themselves according to the gourd gourd gourd ladle. These people will put the compiled programs on the Internet for sale, and those who intend to buy these services only need to pay money It's a game private server with a fool's server building tutorial, which can modify the game parameters by itself. The lowering of the threshold for building a private server means that more games have launched private servers one after another, and even many unexpected games have private servers, such as world of Warcraft, League of heroes, watch vanguard and even Jedi survive The service comprehensively optimizes the existing problems such as balance or playability in the official service, and constantly introduces new content, so many private services are even more popular than the official service.

Imagine landing on the ground with three-level head AWM's Jedi survival, which is probably the feeling (funny)
#How to deal with private services
Most manufacturers hold the same attitude of cracking down on private service as plug-in service. After all, this is a kind of existence that does not melt into the official and legal provisions. As early as 2016, the biggest nostalgic private service of world of Warcraft, nostalrius (n-service for short), was sued by Blizzard, the developer of world of Warcraft, saying that private service infringed the rights and interests of official service, demanded to claim and stop service, and won the lawsuit successfully. This event triggered the dissatisfaction of nearly 150000 people in N-Server and 100000 people who loved nostalgic service, and a total of 250000 players.
This amazing number of people surprised blizzard. Even the elders who once made ancient versions killed back to Blizzard's headquarters and asked for nostalgic clothes to be opened. In the face of this situation, the senior officials were also thoughtful about this, so he invited the producers of n-clothes to negotiate with other private server managers. After many market surveys and discussions, Blizzard decided to launch their own clothes Although the quality of the official nostalgic clothes is poor, it still appeases the dissatisfaction of the players.

Although it is private service, the game environment of n-service is thriving
There is no absoluteness, and not everyone thinks so. There is such a person who is completely open to private servers. He is g Pang. He is almost indifferent to the private server (called community service and platform in the game) of his own game "csgo". Moreover, the server of official service only has 64 ticks (data transmission speed per second), but the server of the platform has 128 ticks. G fat doesn't need to change the server's money, but even if it doesn't change, it can have a better experience and doesn't affect the game. The box should be opened, the accessories should be bought, and what's the fun Why not?

There are many hidden sub-systems on the platform that the official server does not have
    concluding remarks  
The continuous emergence of private server also shows that there are various or big or small problems in the current online game environment. It may be that the game balance is not good, the charges may be unreasonable, or the game content may be too scarce. If the developers deal with the operation of the game properly, how can there be so many private servers? If the game made by the government can't compare with private service, what is the persuasive force to fight against private service?
However, I'd like to remind you that although the experience of private service may be better than that of the official, it is illegal in the gray area in any case unless it's official approval, and it's far less than the official in terms of security and service, so I don't recommend you to try private service.
