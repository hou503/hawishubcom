Some time ago, the new work "dead and stranded" by Hideki Oshima, a famous star producer who left Konami manufacturer in Japan, finally released a 9-minute-long Trailer under the public's attention. Hideki Oshima said that the whole trailer is a real machine rendered picture. From the trailer, we can see that Hideki Oshima used his favorite cinematic expression method in this work. No Whether it's the movement of each lens or the expression of each passage, it reveals a breath of literary and art movies, giving people the illusion of watching a CG movie.

The personal style of the island is vividly reflected in "stranded in death"
In 1993, the science fiction adventure movie Jurassic Park directed by Spielberg came into being. All kinds of dinosaurs in the movie were made with CG synthetic special effects, which gave people a kind of visual experience based on falsehood and truth. It once shocked the global film industry and was called "a miracle of the film age". In the blink of an eye, it is no longer fresh to use CG special effect technology in all kinds of sci-fi films nowadays. However, as a latecomer, video games stand out in the competition of a group of film and television special effects by relying on the flexible use of CG technology. Nowadays, many game manufacturers can even create CG trailers for the game to compete with many films. What's more, they can directly use CG technology to play the game Make it into a movie to realize the cross-border three-dimensional game experience.

T-Rex's debut was too classic
# ten years for games, nine years for CG
Speaking of the "CG factory" in the game industry, the first reaction of players from all walks of life must be blizzard, a game manufacturer from the United States. The game CG or animation launched by Blizzard can always deeply shock the players. It is a common thing for players to tease each other, "Blizzard's trailer can always see the visual sense of the blockbuster" or "an animation company delayed by the game".
As early as 1994, Blizzard began to use CG animation in its own games. At that time, the game manufacturers basically liked to use the form of live performance to make the game to save costs, while only a few manufacturers with real money dare to make CG. When Blizzard's own game "Warcraft" was launched in the early generation, although he had money in his hand, he was still a novice, and his production experience still needs to be improved. In the game, a large number of single long lens CG are used, but for a manufacturer who just tries to do it, it's a very incredible degree.

Stormwind city in the early CG of Warcraft
If we say that the early animation is not mature in all aspects, then we will tune the time back to the "Warcraft 3" period, which is only 8 years away from the initial issue. At this point, Blizzard's CG debut in the game has already been ranked the first tier in the industry. The scenes and lines of many scenic spots have left a deep impression on the players.

Lordaeron in CG of Warcraft 3
Generally in the game industry, CG animation production is outsourced to other studios, while Blizzard has set up a special animation production department within the company. These people may be Blizzard fans or co creators, but all kinds of talents are needed by blizzard. By the time of world of Warcraft, the animation production department has already To reach the scale of 100 people, the opening animation of "world of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King" only took 3 minutes to burn 20 million dollars. It's OK to use this money to develop another game. Why does Blizzard do this? The reason is very simple. They just want to make the story of the game more profound. Although Blizzard's game may not be satisfactory in content, at least we have animation chat to comfort us.

"Watch the vanguard" CG animation "Double Dragons" once sealed Blizzard
# do CG with heart and play games with feet
When you see this title, there may be some ambiguities among players from all walks of life. This name can be used to refer to many game manufacturers, which have a common feature: after you watch the films they broadcast, you will definitely want to buy their games, but after you buy them, you feel deeply cheated. But it is estimated that if we can make a statistics, the voice of Ubisoft from France will be the highest. Earlier, Ubisoft relied on the game of "Assassin's Creed" to publicize CG, which was eye-catching for the new IP. An assassin in a white hooded robe walked on the eaves of a medieval building, revealing a feeling of "cool, cooler, cooler" from the bone.

It's estimated that the most classic scene in the minds of Assassin's Creed fans is the scene of "thousands of troops avoid white robes"
In addition to the assassin's creed, Ubisoft's other games also have CG trailers that are extremely popular. Many of these trailers are regarded as classic works by players, and their sophistication has won many awards for Ubisoft, such as "best game marketing", "best publicity video", etc. But because the CG is too sophisticated, when players get the real game, they discover that the game is not good enough to cause a great sense of difference. The voice of Tucao Ubisoft "CG is too handsome and the game is too bad" is endless. It makes people wonder whether Ubisoft has used the budget to make CG.

The CG of Assassin's Creed: the revolution is exciting, but the quality of the game is poor
Fortunately, after encountering the same problems in one game after another, Ubisoft seems to be relatively convergent in terms of game publicity. The trailer of the game usually uses the real machine demonstration screen of the game, and the publicity intensity is also low-key. In recent years, the game quality of Ubisoft has been significantly improved compared with that before. It seems that the industry has reached a period when CG animation is not needed. For the real game picture, players can be more or less confident when they purchase.

There are only one or two CG previews in "whole territory blockade 2", and the rest are real pictures
#  "our CG ranks first in the world!"  
It is often said that "blizzard in the west, Se in the East". When it comes to CG technology, how can we not mention this Japanese manufacturer, skwell Enix, who is almost paranoid about the picture requirements. Apart from the game industry, se is well-known even in the whole CG technology field. As early as when se hasn't been merged, square has joined CG in her own final fantasy series since 1994's final fantasy 6. As mentioned above, in order to save costs, manufacturers at that time generally used live performance to produce live performance. However, the series of final fantasy has a second-order and different world style, so it's not necessary to make a B-class film in the form of live performance, so first With or without money, CG must be used.

Final fantasy 6's CG has reached the highest standard in the game industry
In 1997, Sakamoto, the father of final fantasy, planned to shoot a long CG movie with final fantasy. At that time, the cost of playing games with CG was very high, let alone making a movie with CG for more than an hour. For this reason, scowell began to issue a large number of new shares, using more than 1000 computers and more than 200 people to jointly produce. The development took more than three years, with a total cost of about 140 million. What is the 140 million concept? In 2008, the total number of robots filmed by Disney was only 180 million. It can be imagined that the 140 million around 2000 is a terrible number.

At that time, the picture of "Final Fantasy: deep soul" had the capital to span two generations
The level of sophistication of the final fantasy: deep in the soul is not out of date even now. Scowell put his family background on the film, and if he doesn't succeed, he will become benevolent. Sure enough, the box office of the movie failed miserably. If it wasn't for Sony's help to merge with Enix, scowell would have gone bankrupt. Despite the failure, Se after the reorganization was not discouraged, but more "intensified". They were almost paranoid about CG technology, and successively made two films with "Final Fantasy".
In 2005, the final fantasy 7: the son of God comes has the same quality as other Hollywood films in terms of both screen and performance techniques. However, the quality of the final fantasy 15: the sword of the king, if not CG, would be considered as a real person, but on the plot depth, there has been no obvious progress. Most of the time, these films are like the extra plot D of the game LC, and you have to go to the cinema to experience it. It's more appropriate to describe SE's CG movie with "jinyuqibiao".

The modeling of characters in the sword of the king is the same as real people
    concluding remarks  
Whether it's the film industry or the game industry, CG technology is really a big hit, but also an important element to determine whether a work can attract the eye. However, it should be admitted that CG is from the relationship with the master in the game, which means that an excellent CG work is born to serve the game itself and make it better. Similarly, CG is not essential for games. It can be but is not necessary. It seems that there are not many manufacturers who can accurately grasp this position in the whole industry. For the sophisticated paranoia, it may ruin their future. In my opinion, instead of trying to make excellent animation for the game, why not just go straight What about animation?
