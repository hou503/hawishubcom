Nowadays, we can see all kinds of 3A masterpieces with beautiful pictures and shocking effects on the market. For the new generation of players, the games they were born with in their cognition should be like this, while those traditional 2D games have become different. These 2D games, which are still innovating today, are more to show respect for their predecessors. After all, without them, today's video games will never have such achievements and development. Even in the era of limited technical force, there are many kinds of 2D horizontal version of high-quality games, so many players who like horizontal version of the game still remember it.

Last year's release of "Rockman 11" still has many players to buy
The recent popularity of "Galaxy like devil city" game "red mark: Night ritual" and shooting game "my friend Pedro" is enough to illustrate this point. Even in such a technologically advanced moment, a well-made horizontal version game can still attract many players. For the game field, horizontal game is undoubtedly a very great existence. We may as well reverse the time to see how horizontal game has changed the game field a little over the years.

# 1970s to 1980s
In 1972, yadali released an arcade game called pong. Although he is not the first game in the world, he is indeed the first game for the public. In order to attract the common people who have not been exposed to this new thing quickly, the game is very simple both in operation and play. There is only one square point and two long white lines in the game picture. The game's playing method is just like playing table tennis to control the white line to hit the white point. If the other side fails to borrow the white point, it is a failure, and the batsman can get one point. To define its type from the current perspective, it is obvious that pong is a horizontal version of the game, and it is such a simple ping-pong game, but it leads the whole trend of video games.

It is worth mentioning that the long strip controlled by players can only move vertically up and down, which is very rare and common in many early video games, such as space invader, centipede, little bee and so on. In these arcade games, players can only move one-dimensional on a straight line. Just a few years later, we have "Pac Man" on the arcade, which can move up, down, left and right. It's also a game work that nobody knows. Besides the new way of moving, we can also see something different from "Pac Man": in the past arcade games, we usually like to take "space" as the main body After all, the space is black, so it's not hard to find that the previous games are all played in a dark dark background, and the game of pac man is actually a designed closed maze, so the concept of "Scene" and "version" has appeared for the first time in the video game. Combined with the two-dimensional movement mode, players can simply interact with the scene Move.

One year after the birth of "bean eater", Nintendo launched a arcade game called "King Kong". In the game, players should play a carpenter with a big nose. The playing method is to control the carpenter to climb up a layer of platform and avoid the obstacles left by King Kong, and finally defeat King Kong to save his girlfriend. In the past, the top view angle of a scene is usually used as a form of expression, so they are not so much horizontal as vertical; however, in King Kong, the side view is used instead, and the purpose of using this view is to make the character "jump". The climbing platform playing method of "King Kong" is more three-dimensional than before, and the side perspective and jumping have become the standard match of the subsequent horizontal version of the game, so it also derived the branch type of "platform jumping game".

In the same year as "King Kong", a horizontal version of the flying shooting game named "defender" was born. The sound and painting of this game were top-notch at that time. Although the scene is still in the dark night sky, the key point is that the concept of "scroll" was introduced in the design of the game, that is, the scene of the game is not limited to one scene or layout of the previous game, but In a super long map extending horizontally like a scroll, players can move in one direction to drive the scene of the game to roll with it. This sense is like sitting in a car and looking out of the window. But unlike looking out of the window in a car, players can move up and down in four directions at will. Powerful music and painting performance, unprecedented game experience, make the game become the existence of ten thousand people in a time.

# 1980s to 1990s
Otherwise, in this era when the uprightness game industry broke out, only three years later, Nintendo's FC home game machine came out, and the way players play is not limited to arcades. As we all know, arcade games usually have score leaderboards, so the playing methods of these games are usually higher than who's score, and since the game is moved to the home, naturally there are many less competitive consciousness like arcade games to enjoy the game as the main purpose.
The hottest game on FC is super Mario Brothers. At first, the carpenter who saved his girlfriend's big nose in "big King Kong" somehow ate mushrooms to save the princess. His identity changed from a carpenter to a plumber. Although all kinds of settings are very wonderful, scroll games can only drag the version in one direction in order to ensure the richness of the map, but the richness of their levels and imaginative playing methods are very novel, and the "Scene" design has also been upgraded Became "level", by these two brothers to create the first version of the game.

This is a picture with sound
Since then, more than 98% of the game works on the home computer platform have passed the level of horizontal version. With the passage of time, many manufacturers pursuing the quality of the game are not willing to use the scroll design. After all, the function is limited. If they want to have better audio-visual effects and scene elements, they need to sacrifice the integrated scroll design.
When the scroll is cut off and re spliced, each scene can realize independent operation, and the splicing is no longer limited to the horizontal, which can also make the game map more refined and huge. It seems that each scene is an independent level. Such a design is also convenient for developers to fill other elements in the game, and the new concept "continuous" The world "was born. The classic game Prince of Persia is designed in this way, and the larger map also derived a "non-linear level", which makes the way to promote the game is not the only one as before.

A variety of designs are constantly superimposed on the horizontal game, and these over advanced designs seem to make the horizontal game reach a bottleneck. I don't know how the game type can evolve for a while. Since the map of the game is large and the content is much, and the overall quality of the game is enough, why not strengthen the players themselves?
Later in the game, we saw a variety of plastic systems, such as changing weapons for the protagonist, adding various auxiliary props, or joining the growth system to learn skills or improve their own attributes. Among them, the representative work is the galaxy Warrior series, which simply means adding the RPG game system next door to the horizontal action game, making the game It's not only to kill monsters, but also to think about the ways to deal with different environments and enemy players, so that the depth and playability of the game can be improved again. Galaxy warrior has also become the target of many subsequent horizontal action games. At this point, the horizontal version of the action game can be regarded as the basic formation.

The map elements of the early Galaxy warrior are very rich, rich enough to produce a single strategy book

With the continuous improvement of technology, the quality of video game production is also rising with the tide, while horizontal game has never stopped its evolution. Now that the technology is strong, the screen is not limited to the traditional 2D, you can also use 3D modeling to make scenes and characters, or you can use 3D rendering to enhance the performance of 2D plane. The types and rules of video games are constantly updated, and horizontal games seem to be like a sponge, which can contain various elements and give full play to their characteristics, even if they are added to the construction system, there is no sense of violation.

Even if it's a 2D horizontal edition, teraria can make "the world of others"
Up to now, horizontal game still has not stopped its evolution. It can be said that this is a game type with infinite possibilities and creativity. Even in the eyes of most people now, he is a very small group, but it is undeniable that his charm can not be easily covered by other popular fast food games. Just as the so-called wine is not afraid of the deep lane, and the horizontal game is like this jar of fermented wine for a long time, the longer it is, the more fragrant it will be; similarly, this jar of wine is only strong and not easy for everyone to enjoy, the anxious drinking will only make people suddenly come on, and only those who really know how to appreciate will wash their taste and praise it.
