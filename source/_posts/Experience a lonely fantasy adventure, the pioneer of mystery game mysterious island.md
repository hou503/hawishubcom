In the nineties of the last century, Action Adventure PC games were all the rage. In Japan, they usually used visual novels with pictures and words and dubbing. In Europe and America, they used to manipulate a character to look for clues around a scene to complete puzzles and promote the game process. In such a big environment, Lucas arts and cyan Inc are the two representatives. The former is famous for "clever exploration and clearance" and "Monkey Island little hero", while the latter becomes a legend relying on a first person mystery play called "Myst".

Monkey island hero 2 Special Edition
For the European and American players in the 1980s and 1990s, "Myst" is a household name. In China, when some players still remember that they have heard the name, the game is as mysterious as his name. But this does not prevent it from being a super quality puzzle game. What it carries is not only the peak of adventure games, but also the pioneer of the concept of "first person puzzle".

# beyond the classic of Diablo
The mysterious Island series has a history of 26 years. It has launched six works and a derivative MMO online game. It is worth mentioning that the fourth generation of the game, mysterious Island 4: Apocalypse, is developed by Yubi bimontllier studio, while the fifth generation, mysterious island 5: the end of the times, is distributed by Ubisoft. This is called cyan The studio also has a lot to do with Ubisoft.
As the author said above, this is the first puzzle game in the history. If you have played the witness by Jonathan Bullough, the God of independent games, you can probably understand what kind of experience it is, but you have replaced the traditional FPS operation with mouse click. For the players who had heard about this game in those years, the most impressive thing is not how fun this game is, but the horrible sales volume of this game:   cyan has achieved sales volume of tens of millions with only two works, almost surpassing the classic RPG series of the same period  .

1993 Mysterious Island
In more popular terms, this is a "  who am I? Where am i? What should I do   in the game, no matter the destination or the plot, or even the puzzles, makes people confused. The protagonist in the game is thrown into a world that looks very strange, and tries to explore in this strange world, to find out the hidden secrets that are not known by others. Many puzzles in the game are often designed in a wild way , players need to fly to open their own brain holes to crack. It is undeniable that many of the design inspiration of the witness comes from this work. It is also a person who explores in a huge open world, which is the core of the mysterious Island series:   experience a lonely fantasy adventure  . The plot of the game is quite obscure. Players need to collect notes and manuscripts in the game and combine them to get the story about the world, which is also the potential main goal of the game.

Entering the game, a scene that can be explored interactively and a mouse pointer constitute the whole content of the game. There is no hint, no guidance, no tutorial, or even the most basic item column of the general puzzle solving game. The advantage of doing this is that the overall view of the game screen is very clear and simple, but the disadvantage is also very obvious, that is, most of the time, the players do not at all Know how to play this game, even sometimes it can't be cracked when you watch the strategy. It's called "hard core" to say it's nice, and "inhuman" to say it's ugly.
The whole game is full of strong philosophical atmosphere. Most of the time, even if the players can read and understand what is written on those notes, they often do not understand it. Therefore, many players often go to try with curiosity, and quit after the experience. Can such a game be played? Nothing has been said. The design of puzzles is still so "hard core". Many times, you can't think with common sense. If you really choose to study and ponder slowly, you will get a very enjoyable adventure experience.

The story of the game tells that there was a race named d'ni on the earth many years ago. They were also human, but they lived a long life, and they lived in the underground world because they hated the light very much. In addition to longevity, this mysterious race has a magic power. They make a kind of strange paper and pen with unknown technology, and can write a kind of book called "the book of transmission" with these paper and pens. The book describes all kinds of strange overhead world. Different books also have different worlds. Take these books to find another one called "the book of connection" Through the book of connection, we can enter into the world of books we carry. Because these worlds are created based on books, the denizens can easily modify the books to change the world in the books, and the players will appear in such a world to explore the story of this mysterious world.

In addition to exploring and solving puzzles, there are no other elements in the game, so the overall style of the game is relatively gentle. Because there is no UI design, most of the scenes are like the demo used to show technology in earlier years, which is very visual impact, so this series can be understood as "walking simulator with solving puzzles". The game has a rather beautiful game picture and soundtrack, and the comfortable rhythm also enables people to focus on the puzzle itself. In fact, the puzzle in the game is not related to the main line of the story, but because its design style and the overall atmosphere of the game create a high sense of fit, so that the players will not have a sense of play. This very intoxicating addictive experience makes the first generation of games attract countless fans once they are on the market, which has won the high praise of the players and the media.

As mentioned at the beginning of the article, in addition to cyan studio, Lucas art is the most representative manufacturer of adventure puzzle games. The game works of the two sides have their own merits, one is the main humorous, and the other is the main comfortable philosophical experience. Taking this as an opportunity, the adventure game began to split, and many subsequent works on the market began to refer to the style of cyan's mysterious island, so there were contradictions and differences between the two sides. Although the game experience of mysterious island is very good, the threshold of its entry is on the high side. Although this style has been welcomed by many players, on the other hand, the game like mysterious island is not friendly to many new players, which indirectly leads to the rejection of the game of adventure and mystery solving. But should this pot really be on mysterious island? I believe that all players who have played this work will not feel this way.

Concluding remarks
Up to now, Lucas art has been acquired, and cyan is still alive. He is still trying to move his works to more platforms, and he is still trying to create new works. Although his glorious historical position has not been inherited by the players, the current situation is very good for a 26 year old game company. Looking at the mysterious Island series again from the current perspective, I believe that most people will feel that it is an out of date work. Both puzzle design and design concept can only be described as low. In such an environment, even if the fire rises, it will definitely be excluded by the players. The golden age of "mysterious island" has passed, and it's time to put an end to it. Fortunately, Jonathan Bullough's "witness" takes this will to continue.
