We all know that the most direct way to win in monopoly is to buy and develop every piece of land on the board, and charge other players a high "toll". The game board has four lines, representing the "four streets". I still remember the horror of being dominated by the "Hotel" in the whole street when I played with my little friends. However, in fact, the game's playing method is already contrary to the original design idea. The idea of game inventors is far from the simple idea that players play the role of landlord to kill each other.

#Progress and poverty
The origin of the story goes back to the 19th century. There is a political economist named Henry George. Because of his poor family, he went out to do odd jobs when he was very young. He didn't have any hard work until his youth. Therefore, he has a clear understanding of poverty and the hard life of the people at the bottom. From the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, the United States just ended the civil war. As a result, it has made rapid progress in economy and technology, and established free economy and market system. As a result, the economic strength of the whole United States has also grown significantly and gradually become a major power.

However, the growth of economic strength does not mean that all people become rich. Because of the intervention of capitalists, the rich become richer and richer, while the poor become poorer and poorer, and the gap between the rich and the poor is suddenly opened. In order to make a living, the poor have to bear the contempt of the rich, but also encourage them to pay for their labor force to make a living. In the long run, there will inevitably be various contradictions, and the crime rate will rise. All of this was in George's eyes. He began to think about how this huge difference came into being. For this reason, he read the works of many old economists and personally visited all parts of the United States. Finally, he came to a conclusion: the key to widening the gap between the rich and the poor was the prevailing private ownership of land in the United States at that time.

Henry became an economist. He put forward his view to the outside world: as more and more land is developed, the land will continue to increase in value. It is easy for the rich to buy land, while the poor need more and more money to buy land. In addition, most of the poor hold the concept of "growing poorer and living", and the population is also increasing, so they compete Competition has become fierce, and the wages of the poor will be diluted by the company. The reality is indeed developing in the direction predicted by Henry. According to this point of view, he wrote and launched his own theoretical work progress and poverty to express his opposition to the private ownership of land. As soon as this book was published, it caused a sensation in the whole United States, triggered public opinion in the whole society, and finally people have a cognition of the reality.

Among the millions of people affected by Henry's work is a media worker named Elizabeth Maggie. She was a feminist, a woman with a strong personality. At that time, feminists were not so pompous as they are now. They were just fighting for the women who suffered from the oppression of their humble status.
By chance, she came into contact with the work progress and poverty. She agreed with Henry's work. At the same time, in order to further verify Henry's theory, she designed a desktop game. In this game, she distributed the chessboard into several identical squares to represent "land" and "Railway". The four corners of the chessboard are various public facilities and Landmarks, considering the high crime rate at that time, one of the four landmarks is "prison", the whole chessboard is square, and the playing rule is to roll dice to control the movement of the chessboard and act according to the contents of the chessboard.

Elizabeth Maggie
Elizabeth named the game "the landlord's game", which is the prototype of "the millionaire" or "strong hand chess". The most unknown thing is that Elizabeth made two sets of rules for the game. The first one is the most familiar way to play the game of land acquisition, toll collection and landowner. This rule is named "monopoly" ". So why doesn't anyone know the second set of rules? The reason is simple: because the rules are "not fun.". Elisabeth named the second set of rules "prosperity". The game is played by any one player's land, whose ownership and income are shared by all players. Until the player with the least capital of the manufacturer also earns twice of the initial capital, the game can be declared over, and all players can win and achieve a win-win situation.

The first edition of "landlord game" color board
No matter from which point of view, the second set of rules is not as attractive as the first set of rules, but actually the second set of rules is what Elizabeth wants to really express. This set of rules can be said to be the epitome of Henry's theory, refusing to privatize the land, and giving back the profits gained from the development of the land to the society, rather than simply enriching the capital family There is no difference between straightness and autocracy. Elizabeth applied for a patent for the game she designed, and specifically stated in the application that "the game aims to show the adverse impact of land monopoly on the economy and the feasibility of using land value tax as a remedy".

Now that the game is finished, we have to find a way to promote the game. It's hard to imagine that when the game was originally designed, it was first spread among adults. Elizabeth hopes to let more children realize the disadvantages of private ownership of land through the game. After all, education starts from dolls. Elizabeth and several friends set up a company to be responsible for the production and distribution of the game. In 1909, Elizabeth found Parker Brothers, the most famous toy manufacturer at that time, and hoped that they could help promote their own games, but they refused. It is said that the rules of the game of landlord are complicated and obscure. It is also said that the game is too political for children to play. Although the Parker Brothers refused to release the game, the game still achieved great success in the public, and Elizabeth's "landlord game" also released various versions.

Map version of landlord game
By the 1930s, the United States had a famous "Great Depression" event, so many people became unemployed. One of the former water heater salesmen, Charles dallow, came into contact with the popular "landlord game" in a visit, but he didn't get the idea from Parker company through the issue: he decided to simplify the rules of the game, redesign the game, and repackage the "landlord game" to Parker Brothers.
The simplified "landlord game" is more like a role-playing game of "being a politician" for players, which was directly adopted by Parker Brothers. This version is later "monopoly". Relying on the ability of Parker Brothers, the game became famous easily. Charles "should" became the "founder" of the game mode, and became a millionaire Weng, it seems that the concept of "plagiarism" existed at that time. Elizabeth's anger at the news was not that her works had been copied, but that the real estate tycoon only had the rule of "monopoly", which was equal to whether Henry George's thought had been determined, but Elizabeth had no choice.

The first edition of "real estate tycoon" not only simplifies the chessboard, but also the design of objects is very handy
    concluding remarks  
In this way, "real estate tycoon" as a pure game without any thought has been handed down. Elizabeth's "landlord game" is slowly submerged by the long history. Fortunately, Elizabeth later proved the ugly behavior of Parker Brothers and Charles in the court through her patent. The truth can be revealed, but "real estate tycoon" is helpless It's hard to change the idea that Charles is the "founder". Although the real estate tycoon admits that the founder is Elizabeth, it's very vague, so as to keep the company's reputation.

The Parker Brothers were acquired by Hasbro, and now they have real estate tycoon
When we played Monopoly in childhood, we didn't seem to think so much about it. We just enjoyed the pure fun of playing games and the blood of fighting with others. The reason why monopoly kept growing was because it showed the real miniature of modern society through a small piece of chess paper. It was not only helpful for children's cognition, but also helpful for children's cognition It's really fun as a game.
