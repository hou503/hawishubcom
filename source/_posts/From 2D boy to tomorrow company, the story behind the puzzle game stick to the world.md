As early as ten years ago, there was no concept of "independent game" in the game circle at that time, but there would inevitably be differences between masterpieces and skits, which we call "mini game". In 2008, I finally got the first computer in my life, but unfortunately, my family didn't allow the Internet. In those years, if you want to play games, you can't help yourself. You can only find friends with nets around you. I get the news of the game through the game magazine, and then I give my friend a U disk to help download. At that time, if the capacity of the U disk is installed in a large work, it will be full, so the mini games with small size and fun playing methods are particularly favored by the author. Such excellent works as "dasbank", "Shanke", and "creation" (I don't know how it is all EA) have left a deep impression on the author, which is still fresh in my memory up to now, but one of them is a puzzle game called "sticky world", which is particularly favored by the pen makers.

Speaking of "sticky world", it's estimated that most people will have heard the name even if they haven't played it. This independent game launched in 2008 has caused quite a stir in the whole game circle. With its unique game style and novel game playing methods, it has obtained the consistent high scores of all media, and has become the most comprehensive independent puzzle game with the highest average score in the game history, and has been up to now There is no one to surpass every day. Since then, 2dboy, the game's developer, has never launched a sequel to sticky world, and its official website has never been updated.
2D Boy
Kyle Gabler is the founder of 2dboy studio. Before the establishment of the game studio, he worked in EA. His works include action game Simpsons and PC Game Sims 2, which are logged into Nintendo's Wii console. In total, he has worked in EA for three years. After leaving EA, 2dboy studio was set up by colleagues who had worked together. Their goal is to play games that everyone can play and no one has ever played, and the great success of sticky world proved that they did. In my opinion, "sticky world" is a puzzle game with physical elements in name, but in fact, it is difficult to define it clearly. After all, in the whole game history, the puzzle game with such unique style and plot is really unprecedented. Although the plot of the game is not understood by people after the game is opened, it coordinates with the atmosphere of BGM and the scene Dye makes all the players who have played have a kind of inexplicable emotion.

The play method of the game is to control a kind of creature named goo (or "goo bean bag", "goo ball") to connect them into a tower or bridge and guide the remaining goo to the air intake pipe. When the guided goo reaches the specified number, it will be counted as passing the customs. There are five chapters in the game, 47 levels in total. Each chapter has different themes, and new content will be added. It is worth mentioning that Kyle, the producer, is also a composer. All BGM in the game is composed by him. I believe that every player who has played will be deeply impressed by the BGM of sticky world.

Although the overall painting style of the game is bright in color, it is also a bit weird. Obviously, the characters in the game are so cute, but there is a dark atmosphere. Although there is no horror content in the game, anyone who plays it will have a creepy feeling, which is similar to Tim Burton's films. In fact, this is what Kyle, the producer, wants to express: the whole game style of sticky world is highly anthropomorphic and human centered. The author intends to show that a high level of civilization may eventually destroy our planet. Besides the game, it is more about giving a big family an association and a reflection on the modern society, calling for people's protection of the environment Knowledge. At the end of the game, a huge telescope looks at the sky, but it can't see through the haze, so goo flies to the sky with the telescope. Not only that, most of the plots in the game express this idea.

# “Tomorrow Corporation Persent”
Only two members of 2D boy studio made it clear after the release of "sticky world" that they would not launch a sequel for it. After that, the studio seemed to disappear without any action. However, shortly after the game was released, the two brought Alan bugistra, the "third fan" who helped develop "sticky world", into the studio and began to plan the development of new works. In order to cater to the theme of the new game, the company changed its name to tomorrow Corporation (tomorrow company), just like the "rusty Lake" series that I like very much. The name of the studio has also become a crucial existence in the game. At first, most people didn't know that the studio changed its name, but until the new promotional film appeared that symbolic and cute again The strange style of painting is known.

The new play, named little Inferno, featured two children sitting in front of a fireplace, heating themselves while burning their toys, which eventually led to a fire in the whole house. Although this trailer doesn't attract much attention, anyone who has seen it will feel confused and no one knows what kind of game it is. When the game actually goes on the market, there is still no way to define what kind of game it is. As shown in the trailer, in a world of ice and snow, the player plays a child, purchases various toys through the purchase of a manual, burns them in his own fireplace and warms them. After burning them, he can get money. There will be additional rewards for burning out a specific combination, and then he can use them The money that arrives then buys toy, burn, make money, go on circulating like this all the time.

The same dark atmosphere, the same confusing plot, but this time the theme is more easy to understand. First, don't let children play with fire. Second, the harm of global warming is very serious. People still need to protect the environment. After the "little purgatory" went public, the company has also redefined several principles. Let's talk about them later. Three years later, the company brought another work called "human resource machine", also called "programmer promotion". The playing method of this game is even more meaningless, that is, programming. They make programming, this kind of very boring work into a very easy to start, but quite deep puzzle game. In Kyle's design concept, everything can be made into a game, even if it's boring. Obviously, this work has become a work suitable for the introduction of programmers in his concept.

Also three years later, tomorrow company brought the sequel "7 billion people" of "human resource machine". The play method of this work is similar to that of the previous one, which is to add the concept of "tools" needed for programming on the basis of programming, making the puzzles in the game easier for people to lose their hair. This work, the previous work and "little purgatory" have a million sales volume after they are released, so the company has earned a lot of income. The more successful it is, the more pressure these three people feel. Because they are so "maverick", they will never add elements in the traditional game, such as "virtual cursor" and "button" (such as game In the play, there are many designs such as "handle key guide", which lead to the game can't be logged in on Sony and Microsoft's hosts. Year after year, the design inspiration will naturally be lacking.

    concluding remarks  
As mentioned above, there are several principles for tomorrow's company to play games. One is to ensure that each game is "unique", the other is to control the development cost of the game, and the third is to enter the market purposefully. In short, the game should be special enough, with high completion and depth. Only in this way can excellent game works be produced. In fact, in order to make full use of the fund for game development, several people have no office from 2dboy. They usually work at home or go to the coffee shop. The fund is All for game engine, music, animation and other design, only to maintain the completion of the game. Generally speaking, these people are a little stupid and naive. They are like three old people sitting on the side of the road. They can't see what's on the road and don't know what's going on. They seem to be behind the times, but even so, they can still give up satisfactory answers.

Indeed, now it seems that only independent game players have such a headstrong and paranoid idea. Most people go to work that they don't like in order to get benefits. Even if they earn money, they are not at ease. If they move forward according to their own wishes, even if they meet four obstacles at first, they will never be satisfied if they succeed. In my opinion, playing games, especially independent games, especially needs this "paranoid" view. Only enough "paranoid" can make better works. There's no need to cater to the market and accommodate others' tastes. If all the games are the same, what kind of "Independent Games" is it?
