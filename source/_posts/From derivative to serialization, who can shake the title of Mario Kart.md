Throughout the whole field of video games, racing games have never stopped moving forward. Today, the market is full of all kinds of game works with different styles, no matter whether they are leisure or virtual, realistic or pompous. Because of its simple and intuitive playing method, racing games can lead the era in terms of picture quality, and the theme can also be accepted by any majority of people. What is puzzling is that compared with other types of games, racing games have never been too large a group of players.

However, there is only such a racing game, which is suitable for all ages, no matter from the playing method or the style, and it still keeps its vitality up to now. He is one of Nintendo's leading IP, even if it is put in the whole field of racing games, it is also the largest and most popular audience. Since the SFC era, it has never lost every Nintendo game console. It is derived from the Super Mario Brothers series, and now it can be called the existence of "masterpiece": Mario Kart.
#  "he's really a go kart"
But anyone who has a certain understanding of the racing culture should know that in reality, the types of racing are very complex, and the simplest sport in all kinds is kart. The so-called karting is a micro sports car, which originated in the 1950s. Compared with F1 or other racing sports, karting can only be described as "simple" in terms of vehicle structure and driving difficulty. The speed and horsepower of the kart are not very big. The leisure kart can run 80 km / h at most, while the racing ability can only run 130 km / h, so it is much safer than other racing sports. However, due to its very low chassis, the driver can feel the relative speed 2 or 3 times faster than the speed. The easy to use, safe and equally stimulating driving experience has made this sport popular with many people who love racing but are afraid of accidents. In history, many F1 car champions are kart drivers, such as legendary car gods Michael Schumacher and Elton Senna.

The go kart that Sena used to drive has been auctioned for 57500 euros (about 412000 yuan)
In 1990, Nintendo launched a science fiction racing game called "f-zero" as one of the first games of the new host SFC, which aims to show the hardware performance of SFC far beyond FC. The sense of speed and thrill of f-zero is rarely matched by racing games today. Due to the science fiction theme, the speed of vehicles in the game can soar to a super high speed of 400km / h. Although they can fully experience the high-speed processing function of SFC, they suffer the players who play. Super high speed means that there is a high demand for the players' reaction ability, which makes the starting threshold of the game quite high. Many players can't even run the whole course. In the middle of the road, because of frequent collisions, the vehicles are exploded. Compared with other racing games, the play method of f-zero is too novel, so it can't be accepted by most players, but the quality of the game itself is still high It's very hard.

SFC version f-zero
Opportunity for     
After that, Nintendo's ace producer Miyamoto attempted to make an SFC game that could support split screen play. In order to enable the players in front of the TV to interact with each other, he still planned to make a racing game. However, in view of the split screen function to split the function of the host, he could not adopt the super high-speed design like f-zero, and in view of the kart at that time The sport was also very popular in Japan, so Miyamoto decided to use karts as the theme. But just driving doesn't achieve the "interaction between players" effect that Miyamoto imagined. At this time, Miyamoto thought of his own series of Mario.

This picture comes with BGM
As early as 1985, Nintendo launched the horizontal action game "Super Mario Brothers" on the FC game platform, which shocked the world for a while, caused the simple and clear play method and interesting design, made the game market which was dead because of "yadali collapse" rejuvenated, and made indelible contribution to the reconstruction of the electronic entertainment market The series of works of "Mario" has also established the name of "Mario" all over the world. Since it's not interesting, why not add the elements of Mario to the go kart? In this way, the game itself will be very interesting, and his goal will be achieved, and with the reputation of Mario, you don't have to worry about the publicity of the game, which can be described as killing three birds with one stone. In 1992, Super Mario Kart, a derivative of Super Mario series, came into being.

Super Mario Kart in split screen mode
Imitator
The highlight of "Super Mario Kart" is that the core of the game is not just to win by speed, but to "pit" each other with other drivers by using various props. People running behind can also have a high probability of rushing to the first place, and the first driver may become the target of tens of thousands of people. At the same time, the operation of the game is very simple, very easy to use, but at the same time, it does not lose the depth, even hard core players can find fun in it. This interesting racing game has been highly praised by the media all over the world as soon as it comes into the market. The supply of the game's card belt exceeds the demand. The sales volume of 8.76 million sets also makes it the existence of the SFC platform "shoulder handle". The success of the game also made Miyamoto realize the potential and value of this work, so he decided to take it out as an independent work and make it on the scale of other Nintendo first party games.

Over the next decade, Mario Kart appeared on every Nintendo game console, both on the console and the handheld. Today, there are eight orthodox works (excluding special edition) in Mario Kart, and even many arcade versions. Each generation is constantly adding new content and new systems, and the map in the game is rarely repeated, but the only constant is the operation method that has never changed for many years, and the playing method is always the same, but each generation has different game bodies Proven. With the new system filling in, the vehicles driven by each character in the game are no longer limited to karts, so later versions of players are more accustomed to be called "Mario racing car".

Like "big fight," many of Nintendo's other game characters have joined the game
There is such a common sense in the game industry: if a game can become a blockbuster, it will inevitably lead to a wave of follow-up among manufacturers. "Mario racing car" naturally triggered other manufacturers to follow suit. Sony, the next door friend, also launched its own host PS, and produced the "old confused wolf racing car" with the theme of "old confused wolf" series. Square, the Japanese manufacturer behind Sony, also launched the "land bird racing car" derived from its "Final Fantasy" series. Today, Sega has also spent many years to create a slightly mature "sonic racing" series, while the naughty dog's "old perplexed wolf racing" is still being launched, although it can be seen that there are no less than the same elements of the "Mario racing" series, but also made its own unique features.

Just released a few days ago, "the old perplexed wolf racing car: remake the plate" has also won a lot of praise from the media
    concluding remarks  
No matter how the works of other manufacturers change, it is difficult to shake the dominance of Mario racing, because compared with other works, it really does it with great care. Especially in the European and American players, the Mario racing series is second only to the Nintendo Star Wars, while the proportion of Japanese and Chinese players is not too much, but not too little. After all, for European and American players, a game to be interesting is the main premise, which is why the popularity of Fortress night in Europe and the United States far exceeds that of Jedi survival. But there is no doubt that the influence of Mario racing series is really big enough, and now it can compete with his original works, and it is still growing.
