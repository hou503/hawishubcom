I have such a hobby. I usually enjoy listening to European and American music in the 1930s and 1940s, and enjoy all kinds of art works with that period as the background. Even the design style of those classic cars will be studied for a long time. If these products from that period are described by the most appropriate two words, they are "elegant" and "extremely elegant".
"Godfather" trilogy and "the Great Gatsby" are the films and TV works that the author has never tired of seeing. He fantasizes that if he can have the opportunity to experience the local conditions and customs of that era, it is not very realistic to think of going back through them. Therefore, video games have become the best carrier to realize this dream.

Little plum's smile is too classic
In the short history of less than 300 years in the United States, there are three periods that writers and artists are most interested in, namely the civil war, the Vietnam War and the urban gangs in the 1930s. There are many works of literature and film and television about gangs, but the games developed with gangs in the 1930s are not common. In this way, a work called "the greatest open world game" was born. Even the GTA series could not reach its height, but after the passage of time, it gradually declined from the glory of that year It's the classic series Mafia.

#  "lost paradise"
Mafia is also known as "brothers of the four seas" and "Mafia" in China. The first generation of the series "brothers of the four seas: Lost Paradise" was born in 2002. It was produced by illusion software, a developer from the Czech Republic. Don't get me wrong. This illusion is not the same as that illusion in Japan. Don't say that "brothers of the four seas" was developed by that adult game company. The story background of the game took place in the 1930s during the Great Depression of the American economy. As a result of the promulgation of the prohibition of alcohol, a large number of black market private alcohol transactions were born. The gangs in charge of these black markets can be said to have mastered one of the "lifeblood" of the citizens and become more lawless.
Generally, according to this routine, we should play a policeman in the game to fight crime or an undercover to infiltrate the enemy. However, in fact, the protagonist of the game is a low-level member of the gang. In order to make a living, we should join the gang and experience the hardship of living outside the law from his perspective.

The map of the game is a combination of Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, which are easy to associate with gangsters. It makes up an American city called "lost paradise", which is also the subtitle of the game. I believe that in the era when the game was released, every player who first came to the city would be shocked by the city's grandeur and surprise.
"Brothers of the four seas" uses the technology of that era to reproduce the United States in the 1930s to the greatest extent. It not only has a real transportation system (speeding will be wanted), but also has a real 1930s style of architecture, vehicle and clothing style. Turning on the radio in the vehicle, it also plays jazz and old-fashioned love songs in a nostalgic style. Players can not only drive their own cars, but also take various means of transportation to explore the city. Many indoor scenes can also be explored. In terms of the degree of detail polishing, even the GTA3 a year ago is inferior.

Unlike other foggy open worlds, the environment of "lost paradise" is very clean
In the game, we can see the bridge section of homage movie Godfather everywhere. Thanks to a classic reference object, the plot design of the game is also unambiguous. Because the plot is very excellent, the specific content will not be described here to prevent the plot penetration. It is worth mentioning that the book was also released by China Xintiandi interactive multimedia agency in China, only a month late than overseas. Although the quality of the game is very good, due to the low popularity, the work did not get much attention after it went on the market. The sales volume of PS2, Xbox and PC together just exceeded 1 million sets.

At that time, TPS games all liked to use this "over back perspective"
#  "welcome to Empire bay"
Because of too much investment but no corresponding return, illusion software was acquired by 2K, a publisher who looked at its strength. After the reorganization, the studio was called 2K Czech. At first, they made a comprehensive transformation of ls3d engine, which was used in the first generation of brothers of the four seas. They kept the characteristics of ls3d and greatly enhanced the engine performance and image performance, only preparing for their next game. At this time, the time has come to the next generation, and all they have prepared is in advance Seek. After four years of development, this new work "Four Seas brothers 2" (more known as Mafia 2 in China), which uses the "illusion" engine polished for many years, has entered the sub era host.

Thanks to the powerful engine, "Four Seas brothers 2" monologue screen in 2010 in a number of 3A big works, even now it is not out of date. Instead of continuing the story of the lost paradise, the novel recreates a new city called Empire Bay, based on New York and San Francisco.
The game still keeps rich details. The whole city is as fresh as it is carved out. But the most regrettable thing is that the promotion mode of the game is not like the general open world game, which is to find tasks to do in the free mode, but the whole article has guidance to guide you where to go next and what to do, but as for when to go, it is up to the players themselves It was decided that players would call this model "linear open world", because in addition to the main task, there are very few things that players can do, which greatly reduces the playability. It is precisely because of this slightly outdated design that the score of the game slightly drops.

The improvement of the picture is very obvious
Fortunately, in addition to the playability, the game is still excellent in all aspects. The media's evaluation of this work is slightly inferior to that of the previous one. With the help of 2K publisher, the exposure of this work is finally improved. The sales volume of this work is not known to be much higher than that of the previous one, and Vito scalrtta, the protagonist of the game, has also left a deep impression on the players because of his vivid task design and handsome appearance This work has also been the most classic work of the series by the players, and people are fond of it.
Players who have been in touch with the whole series should know that the series of "Four Seas brothers" is different from the completely independent plots of each of the series of "GTA". The plots of each generation of "Four Seas brothers" are related to each other. Although the proportion is not high, players will be surprised when they see the previous characters in the new series.

Explosions are rarely seen in the game. Once they appear, they will feel very amazing
# apply formulaic "innovation"
Six years have passed since the second generation was released. Many players once thought that the sequel of this series had become a "lifetime series". When "Four Seas Brothers 3" was officially released and said that it would be released soon, all fans including the author were ecstatic. I don't know if this IP has any special meaning. There are only three works in total, but they are all sold in three different generations. The new works are also due to land on the mainframe of this era. When the game was officially released, the scene could be described as a rush to buy. However, when the players bought the game home and experienced it for a while, they would probably generate the same question in their mind: am I not buying "brothers of the four seas"? What kind of game is this?

The biggest change of the game is that the game developer changed to hangar 13 from the United States, so the overall game design is totally different from the concept of the original studio. In terms of the overall quality of the finished product, the picture can naturally reach the level of this generation, and the overall atmosphere is also very good (nostalgic elements), but the optimization of the game is very problematic, and the repetition of the task is very high, which is not good, and there are many traces of rush work. This time, the game put the story in new Bordeaux in the 1960s, which is now New Orleans. It was a period of extreme racial discrimination, and our protagonist happened to be a black man, so you can expect what kind of story can happen.

The temperament of the game is different from what it used to be
The plot design of the game is quite excellent, but the highly repetitive tasks and a large number of bugs have caused a devastating impact on the players' sense of substitution. If the previous work is like a thin skin, big pleats and many hair pouches, it's like a steamed dead face bun with both ends of the skin connected together. Although it can be eaten, it's better in both delicacy and taste The front work is much worse.

"Shall I tell you that I've learned to float on water before?"
    concluding remarks  
The reputation of "brothers of the four seas" is worse than each other, but the funny thing is that the sales volume is higher than each other. The series relies on the high quality of the first two works to continuously accumulate new fans. However, it encounters Waterloo in the latest work, instantly pulling the players' mood to the bottom. In the minds of fans, the "brothers of the four seas" series has always been like a literary and art movie. He doesn't need too hot pictures. He just needs to tell a story that can resonate with the players. Even if he likes the retro elements, the design against his original intention will only disappoint the fans who like the series.
Seeing that the story of brothers of the four seas is about to enter the end of the 20th century, it is still about to come to modern times. If the follow-up works are going to continue to be told later, it is bound to have a lot less charm than only the 1930s. I hope that the follow-up works of brothers of the four seas can be a series restart, bringing the time back to the beginning of the 20th century, but then again, can there really be a sequel in one's lifetime?
