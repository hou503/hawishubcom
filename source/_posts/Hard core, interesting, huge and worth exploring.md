If we can say what the game works I am most looking forward to in the future, it must be the outer worlds produced by Obsidian studio. I am a loyal fan of Fallout Series and half a sci-fi fan. This so-called "space version of radiation" works can't help but arouse people's hearts ã€‚ Although the picture and battle part of "tianwai world" look very common in the current intelligence, it is worth looking forward to at least the unique style of obsidian in network narrative task design, game mechanism and system. After all, obsidian's game has never sold well.

No one can fully understand the existence of space. For people, it is always full of mystery. In the vast universe, there may be beautiful scenes that have never been seen before, or unknown crises hidden in the dark side of the planet. No matter what, it will arouse people's curiosity and give people an impulse to explore. Obviously, the exploration of the universe can only stay in the imagination for us, and we can explore it in another form through some media. All along, the author is looking forward to a game work that can truly realize the exploration of the universe at will. Although such a game is not without it, it seems that it is always a bit strong and unsatisfactory.

#The most "hard core" universe
Speaking of the most famous game in the game field, eve online (Star Wars Eve) is a hard science fiction Simulation online game produced by CCP game company of Iceland. It has been in operation for 16 years, with extremely stable user group and update frequency. After all, as a space theme game, there is no complex scene design, only the accuracy of the model and the light and shadow can keep a high level of screen. Eve is an online game dominated by players. Players can carry out various activities in this universe with super freedom. You can be a businessman wandering between various galaxies, or a heavy industry worker. What most people yearn for is to be a fleet commander in charge of strategizing and Defending Forces in the universe.

So many game content, looks very attractive, should be very popular by reason. However, in fact, the players of this game are losing even if the user group is no longer stable. The main reason is that this hard science fiction game is "too hard". Without the guidance of the old players, the novice may not understand the operation of the game for a day. At the same time, the game is a time charging system. In the game, you need to spend a lot of time learning skills for your characters. Only when you learn the skills can you survive in this universe normally. Just like students in class, only when you learn the knowledge can you know how to do exercises.

These two very "hard core" settings lead to a very high threshold of the game. In the current fast-paced game environment, it is clear that "Eve" is no longer popular. In fact, in my opinion, if the guidance and teaching part of the game in the early stage can be simple and clear, and at the same time, a new channel can be established to let old players and new players communicate with each other, it can not only greatly reduce the threshold, but also retain the content of the game.

#The most "interesting" universe
If you want to explore the universe, the first and most basic requirement is that you have a way to go to space. When it comes to going to space, it is essential to have a spaceship. The space simulation independent game "kerbal space program" created by squad using unity3d is a game work to simulate and build a spaceship. In the game, the player plays a worker of Kambala aviation, and needs to design and launch rockets, spaceships and orbiters by himself depending on various modules provided for the player in the game Explore the entire kerbol galaxy. In essence, this work is also a sandbox game. It has a highly customized system and certain open source. Players can install a variety of mods for the game to increase functionality. At the same time, the characters in the game are very magical. Because of them, the game is not so serious though it is quite deep.

It's not difficult to build a spaceship. The difficulty lies in whether it can be successfully launched and work normally. In view of the highly customized system of the game, players can also create all kinds of wonderful spaceships at will. In most cases, it's impossible to send a spaceship to the sky only by brain holes, so players need to try again and again. At first, the spaceship may land and explode when it's launched, but the elements in the game are quite interesting, which can let players master the use of a large number of complex tools in fun, and finally let the rocket rush out of the earth after repeated failures. What players felt at that time The sense of achievement received is unparalleled.

It is worth mentioning that the birth of this game came from the dream of a gamer. Before the birth of the game, the game development group squad had planned an activity called "make dream come true" for its employees, which let them recommend their own ideal game plan and make it a real game. One of the employees, Philip faranger, put forward the idea of "building a spaceship into space". He said it was his dream from childhood. At last, the two founders of squad decided to fund the project, so they had the work. The name of "Kambala" came from the name of the tin paper man tied to the fireworks when Philip was a child.

# the largest universe
Question: which game map is the biggest in the current game field? It is estimated that a considerable number of people will say "my world". At first, due to the random generation of its map, many people thought that the map of the game was an infinite map continuously generated outwards. This turned out to be a rumor later. According to the official, if a square is one meter, the map of my world can reach the size of 60 million times 60 million square meters without the limitation of hard disk memory, and the end is the invisible bedrock. In this way, the map area of "my world" can reach the size of 7000 earth, which is a very exaggerated figure. And there is an excellent map bigger than my world, which is the famous space sandbox adventure game "no one in deep space".

Although "no one in deep space" was once called as consumer fraud by players when it was launched, few of the openings boasted at the E3 conference were actually realized, but for the first time, it is true that at least 184.4 billion (yes, two billion) planets are officially promised for players to explore, because these planets are all randomly generated by the system It will take 585 billion years for players to explore every planet for a second. This number is not something players can accomplish in a lifetime. For a space game, it's like a dream to have so many stars to explore at will.

After more than two years of supplement and update, the players gradually accepted the game from the beginning of "everyone shouting and fighting". The developer, hallo games, is trying to fulfill the promise he made to the players little by little, and is constantly adding new content to the game. The game has gradually entered the right path. If "no one in deep space" two years ago was an unshaped and ugly original stone, after two years of continuous polishing and polishing, the current version of it has become a shining gem. Although it still fails to reach the rich universe when E3 was displayed in that year, the comprehensive optimization of the content and the real decoration of multi person mode brought by the update make it an excellent work worth experiencing for a long time.

    concluding remarks  
People are always curious about the unknown. Although there are endless treasures in the sea to be explored, the size of the sea is still limited, and will be exhausted one day. No one knows where the end of the universe is, and no one knows how big the universe is, and how many stars there are in the sky. This mystery may be forever We can't get the answer, but it's a good thing to feel the mystery and greatness of the universe in a safer way.
