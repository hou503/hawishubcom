Since the 1980s, it was the most popular and prosperous period of video games. It has a history of nearly 30 years. In the 30 years, we not only witnessed the evolution of video games from the original eight pixels to the top picture which is infinitely close to reality, but also witnessed the birth and glory of a great work or legend series. In the 30 years of history, some works may have been forgotten by people, and some works' sequels have become "lifetime". And only a few people know the existence of great influence, perhaps to this day still tenacious to live, and live more moist.

Among these works of "high age", some of them are consistent, relying on stable and firm quality to win, while others are trying to connect with the new era and organically combine themselves with other elements, with the purpose of trying to live longer as much as possible. And the times are changing, people's taste and vision are also no matter innovation, how to make the right choice for their own situation has become a big problem that these "time-honored brands" must consider.

#  mod and editor
When it comes to the secret recipe that can prolong the life of the game, it naturally belongs to mod and various editors. In essence, this is that the developers of the game provide some permissions for the players to play a game, improve the open source of the game itself, and encourage the players to participate in the creation of extra content of the game. After all, everyone has different ideas and inspiration, so everyone can create different content, constantly inject fresh blood into the game. This way mostly appears in a single game, and it will follow when the game is launched. Generally, it can improve the playability of a game to the maximum. Making mod for the game can enrich the content of the game, change the model in the game, add some functions for the game itself, and so on. With the help of the editor, you can play the game by yourself in a very simple and understandable way Every element of the game, including the model, map and even the rules of the game can be freely modified by the players, so as to increase more playability on the basis of the original game.

Image quality enhancement mod of gta5
Take a few typical examples: the open World RPG game "ancient scroll 5" produced by Bethesda has a very high open source. Because the open world of the game itself has a higher degree of freedom and a more realistic ecosystem than other games, in the eyes of developers and players, this is a world worth exploring. Every time you play, you will have a different feeling, but also Because of this, many players are willing to develop a variety of mods for this game, replace the characters in the game or add new functions, and even some can directly change the game into a completely different game. In terms of making a completely different game, the editor has a greater say, such as the current popular MoBa and big escape type games are derived from games with an editor.

# stick to the rules
For a game that has achieved extraordinary results from the beginning, the more difficult it is to continue, the success from the beginning means that the game itself has excellent design in some aspects since its birth, and usually the success of a game means that it can create profits for developers, so in most cases, it will try to launch a sequel. And the word "sequel" means that it can either be equal to or better than the previous one. If it is even a little worse than the previous one, it will be considered as a step backward. In order to successfully launch the sequel and stabilize the reputation of the game, developers usually choose to adjust on the basis of previous works, try to bring some new content to the players on the basis of previous works in each generation of works, or insist on launching works that are not different from previous works according to a mode, but simply change the screen and the general plot.

All kinds of sports games are usually out of picture promotion, only need to modify the data
Take ghost cry 5, which was released at the beginning of this year, for example. Its first generation of works was born in 2001, which is still an old IP with a history of 18 years. When it was born, it was called the benchmark of action game in the industry. Even the Ghost Warrior series, which was earlier than his birth, failed to win this honor. It is also called "three generation act" game together with Ares and forbearance dragon series. For a long time, the series of "ghost cry" has been selling points with elegant scene design, handsome and gorgeous fighting style, full tension plot performance and deeply rooted characters. If these key points are inherited to ensure their quality, then this game will not be worse. The most obvious example is that the second generation of the series of leading role Games has changed the leading role from a glib ruffian to a cold and dark boy, so the sales volume of the game has been directly impacted. There is a gap of nearly ten years between the four and five generations. I thought that the five generations would have a drastic reform, but I didn't expect that they were still familiar with the original taste, but the picture became better and the content was rich.

# self innovation
For a series of games, perhaps the most difficult thing is to try to add innovation to each generation of works, especially for works with relatively fixed and single playing methods. Generally, the works that want to try in the new works are either bad at the beginning and want to recover the situation through innovation, or limited and the change of the times, afraid that the consistent will not be accepted by the mainstream. As for how to innovate the game, let's see what the developers have to refer to and whether the IP in hand can be applied to this idea. The advantage of this approach is that it is very easy to fill and modify the shortcomings in the game with new elements, while the disadvantage is that many times, the ideas with good consistency in the eyes of developers are not matched or even have negative effects from the perspective of players.

Call of Duty: modern war, a new edition of comprehensive innovation, is probably the highest quality work in recent years
Take the Ares Series in the three act games as an example. As we all know, Ares series always has a large scale, many elements of violence and blood, and takes the Greek mythology in the dark style as the main tone. The operation difficulty of the game is not high. Compared with the complicated tactics of each weapon in ghost cry series, it is much simpler, usually according to the different types of enemies Switch equipment, and the operation of most moves is basically universal. From the first generation to the third generation, the works have always been in a refreshing style, while in the latest series, in view of the revenge story of the protagonist Kratos has ended, so the style of the new work has changed from the main battle to the main narrative, and some RPG elements have been added on the original basis, which makes this work more profound than the previous work, and the game process with a slightly slower rhythm is quite in line with the role For an influential work of some years, the seemingly drastic reform has actually become a bonus item of the game. We have to admit that the reform of the development team is very bold, but more complementary.

The new ares is even better than the previous one. The game of the year is not played
    concluding remarks  
It's not easy to maintain a game's vitality. A slight change is likely to affect the tone and style of the integrated game since its birth. If there's a little carelessness, it's likely to hit the signboard. Therefore, if these games need to be adjusted or changed, they also need a lot of deliberation and long-term polishing. Generally, works with the same or even better quality can be kept for many years, which are popular and influential.
