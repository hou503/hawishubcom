In February this year, the mecha action game "hymn" developed by the studio BioWare under EA officially went on sale, which excited many players who were excited by watching the trailer earlier, saying that they had been impatient to think of the feeling of being a steel man in the game. However, when the game was released, the players found that the actual content of the game was far from the description on the original trailer, giving a feeling of being cheated, and the word-of-mouth of the game fell sharply, thinking that at the beginning, how many players did not know how much they had fantasized about the work, and now the fantasy is also broken.

As we all know, there are all kinds of mecha games, but only a small proportion in the field of games, but the players who like mecha games don't know how many. The theme of mecha is not limited to the field of games, including film and television, animation, and model play. Every boy will feel hot because of the friction of gears on mecha, the collision of metals, and the gushing of steam. Therefore, the "mecha culture" across many fields is also called "man's romance". And we don't know when to start, it's not hard to find that not only are there large foreign factories starting to play the game of machine armour, but also many domestic manufacturers start to have ideas, just as if there is any chance, the game of machine armour suddenly becomes popular.

# less people doesn't mean cool
In the early years of the game circle, the robot game is a big one, but although there are many kinds of games, few of them can really be called hot. Mecha culture is mainly popular with Japan. Under the framework of "no separation in ACG field", both games and animation are very popular. When it comes to Japan, we may think of Kodak first, but in fact, the main active field of Kodak is not in the game circle, mainly animation and model, and the game is only a derivative product. The Super Robot War series released by the Wandai Nanmeng palace is a carnival for the fans of robot animation. It is a strategic role-playing game, which gathers classic characters from various robot animation, and can realize the multi-dimensional chaos of many robot animation.

Once the game was launched, it was deeply loved by mecha fans. But now it's nearly 30 years since the first generation of the game was launched. Dozens of works have been launched, and people who like those classic characters are not young. The new generation has little feelings for these "old antiques", but as the author said at the beginning, not many boys will resist mechaã€Š In this way, with the support of fans, the series of "aircraft battle" came here tenaciously.

In terms of animation performance, "aircraft battle" has the performance effect of not losing animation
There is another work in Japan, which is remembered by people by CG animation with a strong "hard science fiction" flavor, but few players have ever played this work. This is the armor core series produced by fromSoftware. FS has played "hard core game" all his life, and Armored Core series is no exception. This series is an action game, the quality is good in general, but the threshold of the game is very high, and it is not friendly to new players. In the game, the robot customization system is very powerful. Careful parameter adjustment can make people look big. To create a powerful robot for themselves is not just a work that can be completed by patience. It is because of its very unfriendly difficulty that most players flinch from it, but just like "black soul", although it is difficult, some people will still like it. The charm of "armor core" can only be really enjoyed by players who like both hard core and machine armor.

However, due to insufficient technical strength and unsatisfactory sales volume, the Armored Core has been snowed by FS
#The status quo of machine armour games
In general, although the robot game has a profound cultural background, it will always be the joy of a small number of players. However, although the audience of the game is small, the relevant film and television works are very popular. Compared with the Japanese hot blood, it seems that people can accept the European and American style of large-scale production. The hot shows of transformers and the Pacific rim are the best proof. Although the "hymn" mentioned at the beginning of the article is also known as machine armor, it tends to be more like the armor of iron man. Although the game is very common, the success of the movie proves one thing to people: machine armor can be accepted by most people, only depends on the selection of materials and game style.

Earlier, "Titan falls" produced by EA also started a good start. The quality of the game itself is not bad, but it is helpless to lack of operation experience and be eager to succeed, which makes the game cold. Since the "hymn" brought the robot back to the players' vision, there are more robot games on the market. For Sony, in the early Chinese star support program, a Chinese game producer brought a work called "hard core machine a". From the beginning of the publication of the game, the author paid close attention to the trend of the work. This is a 2D horizontal action game. Players need to operate machine a to perform various tasks.

The original name of the game was "code name: hard core", which is much better than the new name
There are two reasons for the series to attract the author. One is that when the game was first released, the author felt that the 2D screen was used but the production was very good. The design of both human and environment can reflect the good intentions of the producer. The other is that the producer is an independent game producer in China, and the game was developed with the help of Sony, which makes the author feel very good Excited, because the robot games themselves are small, let alone the domestic robot games are even fewer, in addition to the domestic independent development of "the great Qin warrior" many years ago, I really can't think of any other works.

"The great Qin warrior" is definitely an underestimated work. Its design concept is very advanced. Unfortunately, it didn't catch fire
In such a mood, reality quickly replied to me: the first one is Netease, which brings a big escape game called "mobile city alpha". The author once had such an idea, since the big escape game is not in line with the national conditions, and no one is allowed to be injured, why not make a big escape game of robot versus war? Then Netease handed over his answer sheet. In the game, players can summon mecha to fight by accumulating energy. Different characters have different skills. Players can use these characteristics to cooperate and fight.

It used to be called ace. It's very pleasant to say that it's quadratic + mecha + eating chicken
Tencent can't be idle after Netease's action. Its next studio also plans to launch a machine armour fighting game called metal duel. At first glance, the style of the whole game feels familiar. Isn't that the big fire movie "iron armour and steel fist"? Although the developers have made their own style in this game, they will still give the players a strong sense of both seeing, but fortunately, many players still like this style very much. By the way, the game was planned to be launched in April this year, but it will be finished in June, but it is still missing.

    concluding remarks  
As early as the popularity of mobile games, there were many mobile games with the theme of robot armor overseas. The author has contacted several kinds of mobile games, and found that they all have a common fault, that is, the robot armor is very heavy, not as handsome as the robot armor people usually know, and there are no cool weapons and gorgeous special effects. If you compare them, it's more like a more flexible platform with long legs Gram. The last time I saw this kind of machine armour in the game was in Battlefield 2142 more than ten years ago. It is certain that no one will like this kind of machine armour.

Bipedal mecha can be said to be the symbol of Battlefield 2142, but such excellent works are now cool
There are different styles of mecha Games launched in the market one after another, which makes a good start for the subsequent games of related subjects. It is not that mecha games are not pleasant, but that they are really not easy to do. The hardline style doomed that this kind of game will only be favored by boys. If it is smashed, it is the real wealth. With the emergence of more and more robot games, especially those made in China, maybe in the future, this niche theme can open up a new road of its own in this new land.
