On April 20 this year, Nintendo's game boy, a handheld game machine, celebrated his thirtieth birthday. Although it is not the first handheld machine in history, it is definitely the most influential and famous. Even now, game boy's sales can also be ranked at the top of the sales list in the whole game machine industry. If its subsequent derivative products (colored GBC and portable version of GBP) are counted as one of them, its sales can reach an amazing 120 million, which can be called a legend of an era, and it is also the first product that dare to challenge the status of the game console.

But the players who have been playing video games since that time will probably know that game boy has not much advantage in performance, nor is it a very novel original new machine. On the model, there are even many latecomers who can surpass game boy, but only game boy really laughs at the end. The success of game boy is not the result of strong wind, but also a lot of hard work and sweat.
     fumble  
The concept of "portable game machine" has been formed as early as the 1970s. The first manufacturer to make this concept into a real product is matte, a toy manufacturer from California, USA. in 1976, matte launched a handheld computer called "matte electronic auto race", which is the first handheld electronic in the real sense Recreational machines.

"Mattel electronic racing" pilot
Later, Mattel also launched handhelds of different styles and playing methods, such as "e-football", "e-basketball", "e-football", etc., but all of them have a common feature that one machine can only play one game. In order to get rid of this bondage, Mattel later launched the "micro vision", which can support the replacement of game content, in 1979. Mattel's "micro vision" design concept is quite advanced. The game is placed on the removable palm case with the main board, and the effect of replacing different games is achieved by replacing different cases. The world's first palm with expansibility is recorded in the history of the world, but the price is expensive due to the advanced concept of the palm itself, and the battery will overheat And burn the phenomenon of motherboard, so slowly fade out of the players' vision.

Mattel "micro vision" handheld
At that time, Nintendo was just entering the video game industry. After they launched their first video game platform, "color TV Game 6", they planned to build a handheld like Mattel, but Mattel's handheld was too generic, and they wanted to do better, but after all, Nintendo was still in its infancy, so they had to explore it slowly One year after the launch of Mattel's micro vision, Nintendo learned from Mattel's lessons and started at a low speed. It launched the dot matrix camera "game & watch", which is also a one machine one-time tour, but with a color screen sticker background.

All kinds of "game & watch"
The birth of "game & watch" has something to do with a man named Yokai Junping. The design inspiration of "game & watch" comes from the sight of someone playing with a calculator because of boredom while riding on Shinkansen. In order to try out all kinds of ideas, "game & watch" has launched about 60 kinds of styles and more than 10 kinds, including all kinds of Nintendo's fantastic ideas, including flip screen, split screen, removable handle, cross key, etc. It's easy for us to understand. It can be said that many design ideas of "game & watch" have a direct impact on the design of many subsequent models of Nintendo.

At first glance, this clamshell "game & watch" thought it was NDS
  second attempt
At the same time, Walkman, introduced by Sony, has become popular all over the world, changing players' perception of digital products due to its novel design of replaceable card tape. Yokai Junping, who created "game & watch", was also deeply influenced by it, which also gave him the desire to make a palm with expansibility like Mattel.
Although "game & watch" has more than 60 models, and its sales volume has not reached Nintendo's expectation, which once made Nintendo almost give up its handset business. However, in view of the need to launch another product to fill the gap period before the launch of the next host FC, Nintendo society is still in a position of being a giant Jingjunping's project has given a green light, but at the same time, it has also ordered yokogai Junping to make a hand machine that will surpass "game & wactch" in an all-round way and its performance will be equal to FC's. at the same time, the price will be close enough, which is simply to improve, strengthen and control the cost.

Yokai Junping, father of game boy (late)
It's difficult to achieve all these goals with the strength of Yokai Junping alone. Therefore, Yokai Junping found shangmurakami from sharp, a hardware supplier. They decided to cooperate in the design and development of new machines. Referring to the previous "game & watch" design concept, yokogai Junping maximized the portability of the new machine, and added three-dimensional channel and multi person online function to it. At the same time, he also planned to transplant many first-party masterpieces on FC platform to the new machine to enhance the first game lineup of the new machine.
But even though everything seems to be going well, there are problems in the hardware of the screen: after all, President Yamauchi has the order to strictly control the cost of the new model, so Yokai does not plan to use the color screen on the new model, but the same TN LCD black-and-white screen as "game & watch". This kind of LCD screen is similar to the specifications we usually use on calculators. It is usually more clear when we look at it sideways rather than from the front. However, the size and shape of the new model are far from the "game & watch", so when we hold it, we can't see it sideways as before, and even feel serious residual shadows and very unclear pictures when we play.

The 76 year old masakura
This kind of thing is bound to fail. President Yamauchi stopped the development of the new machine. At this time, shangmurakami came forward to tell President Hengjing and President Yamauchi: he heard from his colleagues in the previous company where the headquarters is developing a display screen with new technology, and there has been no small progress. Using this display screen may solve this problem. Although the cost has increased slightly, Yamauchi is not willing to let the production of the new machine fall short. After all, if it is not done, the money invested before will be wasted. They have to unify this transaction. Finally, the problem of image display was solved by many attempts and adjustments of various employees, and it was successfully moved to the shelves in April 1989. However, only the balance of hardware is not enough to establish the success of GB, and the greater reason is attributed to software.

The GB screen is not so much black and white as black and green
End of  : our hands are addictive
Before GB's sale, Nintendo had a long-lasting "psychological war" with yadali and Sega. From Russia, Nintendo got the right to sell the computer and mainframe of Tetris, a video game that was popular all over the world at that time. In the future, we just need to know that Tetris was always a PC Game before, but it has also been a PC game Let the world know how many people indulge in it. Before that, Yamauchi asked Nintendo producer Miyamoto: is the game fun? And Miyamoto's answer is, "of course, it's fun. Your family are playing too." This also let Nintendo know the charm of this game.
Nintendo chose to bundle the game with the game boy handheld, attracting a large number of players' desire to buy with the gimmick of "Tetris" that can be carried with them. Many people chose to buy new machines with the idea that "I bought GB just to play Tetris", which also led a wave of GB sales.

GB version of Tetris
The game works that let GB take the computer to the sky step by step are not the legend of Zelda: Dream Island, or Super Mario, but the Pokemon (now called "fairy treasure dream"). With the coming of PS host, many game developers have turned to Sony, which made GB's game lineup very depressed. At that time, game freak, the second-party manufacturer of Nintendo, came out and tried to open up the children's game market by designing an animal to animal game. This was the first time to log in to GB's Pokemon: Red / green.
At first, the game didn't achieve much success, and even was criticized by the players because of the game bug. But after all, it is a game product for children's market. How can there be no propaganda measures? So the animation and comics adapted from the game have been launched one after another. The cross-border publicity of animation and comics relies on high-quality plot and production success to earn people's attention, and they have rushed to buy GB and Pokemon. GB has become the existence that players can't let go of, day and night can be a dream.

Pokemon: Red / green game cover
Since then, Nintendo has realized the importance of software for a game machine. The performance deficiencies can be made up by the quality of the game. If the game is not fun, no matter how strong the machine performance is, it will not help. So there is now Nintendo host "full screen game" of the view. But the joke is the joke. Who would deny that Nintendo's game is not funny?
Game boy plays an important role in the whole history of game development. It not only creates brilliant works by Nintendo, but also guides many later game manufacturers. It is like a burning candle, which inspires others and submerges itself in the long river of history with the passage of time. Although it is so out of the water now, it has left us Beautiful memories can never be forgotten.
