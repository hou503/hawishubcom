On February 27, this year, Nintendo announced the eighth generation of its original sequel, baokemeng: Sword / shield, at the new baokemeng face-to-face meeting, which coincided with the 23rd birthday of baokemeng. In this day of universal celebration, players cheer for the release of the new work and celebrate the birth of Baoke dream in different ways. As we all know, there are few people around the world who don't know the divine IP of "Baoke dream". Even if they haven't played games, they also know what kind of creature "picassu" is, which is enough to prove its influence.

However, just four months later, the players who used to shout to buy the game have launched a protest against Gamefreak, the developer of the game. The reason is that at the E3 game exhibition just concluded a few days ago, Shunyi Zenda, the game producer of baokemeng series, carefully made a decision that made all fans of baokemeng sad at the E3 face-to-face meeting: only use the new regional atlas in the new work, and any baokemeng not appearing in the atlas can not be transmitted into the game through Pokemon home.

The atmosphere at the scene was once very awkward
#  "it's really yours, Gamefreak"
What does this decision mean? Pokemon home is Nintendo's online baokemeng storage service for the "fairy baokemeng" series. With this service, players can take baokemeng from one platform and store it in Pokemon home, and then transfer it to another platform through data conversion. In this way, the transmission of baokemeng can be realized across games and platforms. Their favorite baokemeng Can also accompany the player all the time.
However, this function is based on the premise that the transmitted game contains the data of Baoke dream. If "Baoke dream that does not appear in the book cannot be transmitted" as mentioned above, it means that the number of Baoke dream appearing in the new book will be far less than that in the National Book of Baoke dream world. The official said that in the new work, there will only be new baokemeng in the new area and some old baokemeng after selection. The total number may not exceed 400. In fact, there are more than 800 baokemeng in the new work, and more than half of them have been cut down directly and vividly, which is commonly known as "dating".

At first, the service was called Pokemon bank, while Pokemon home was a customized service for new works
At first, fans of baokemeng discussed on the eve of E3 how game Freak (GF for short) should adjust its balance against a large number of baokemeng. After all, the game is still dominated by confrontation. In the future, it will be very difficult for all baokemeng's works to come on stage. Meanwhile, it will also cancel the previous feature system Mega evolution and Z skills. At first, the existence of mega evolution and Z skills is to make up for the imbalance of baokemeng's ability caused by the large size of the game. This is good. The problem of balance has been solved. The previous solution used to solve balance has also been solved.

The flamethrower dragon with two kinds of mega evolution has always been favored by players
All the old players in the baokemeng series should know that this is not the first "era break" of the baokemeng game. As early as 2002, the fairy baokemeng: ruby / sapphire, which was released with the GBA handheld platform, also had such a situation. Due to the early and technical reasons, there is no way to transfer the data from the previous Gameboy platform to GBA platform, and there is no way to obtain these gems in red / sapphire.
This event directly led to the intuitive impact on the sales volume of the game, and the players expressed that they could not accept it. If there is no way to obtain these treasure dreams, then they would not buy them. GF seems to have planned for a long time. After the launch of red / sapphire, it re engraved "baokemeng: Red / green" on GB to GBA, and "baokemeng: Gold / silver" on GBC platform to downward compatible NDS, which solved the problem of "generation separation". After the problem is solved, players will naturally be "really fragrant".

Baoke dream: the ultimate ruby / original sapphire, which was remade on the 3DS platform, is my favorite
As a reproduction of "baokemeng: Huang", a GB platform, baokemeng: let's go Pikachu / IBU, which was launched a year ago, has also been criticized by players. But in GF's view, this work is to attract new players who enter the pit due to mobile game "baokemeng go". No matter in system or setting, it has the same points with mobile game. The deletion and simplification should be simplified. Old players are not willing to admit that this is an orthodox sequel, only use it as an "external" work for publicity purposes, so how much of it can still be received. In this case, it's terrifying that this work can easily achieve sales of tens of millions of levels, which also improves the sales volume of NS hosts.

The setting of new works is more inclined to new players who have never been exposed to orthodox works
# pour out anger
After Nintendo treehouse's baokemeng demonstration (treehouse is the name of Nintendo's North American Department) was released on the Internet during E3, the players were not optimistic about the game at one time, and the number of clicks was several times as much as the number of likes, and this video also once became the demonstration video with the most clicks during E3.

Ranking of the number of video games "trodden" at E3 in 2019
In response to the players' protest, GF naturally also needs to explain, but they have come up with one of the most unconvincing reasons: 1. The development of baokemeng on the NS platform will increase the development cost; 2. Time is limited and it is impossible to estimate the balance and quality of too many baokemeng.
This is a word that ignites the anger of fans. Why? If you're a big fan of the Baoke dream series, you should know the rumor: Nintendo has tried to provide technical support for GF many times, but it was rejected by GF. We don't know the truth of this rumor. What we can know is that GF, who holds the world's first IP development right, naturally doesn't need to worry about money. After all, it's tens of millions of sales, so the claim of development cost doesn't hold at all. Since money doesn't want to spend money to improve technical and human resources, that's the company's own problem, so the second one is The law is not established.

Players spontaneously launched the topic of "bringing back national DEX" on the Internet, which led to the participation of online games. At the same time, players reviled gf's incompetence and begged GF to complete Baoke's dream, even if the game was released later.

And so forth
Recently, a netizen made such a comment:
![In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage](aefe4093328a47cc895d8296552903bc.jpg)
In other words, it takes five minutes to model a Baoke dream, while it only takes 60 hours for 800 Baoke dreams to express their dissatisfaction with GF. In response to this speech, many players said that they "don't have back pain when standing and talking", "you can go up" cloud cloud cloud, but also capable players said that five minutes is really enough, they have to try and publish their works on the Internet.
Most of these works are in the style of abstractionism, but there is no lack of gods coming out to show decent things. No matter what the quality of the works is, they are all venting their dissatisfaction to GF. In the face of waves of players' protests, GF seems to be disappearing without giving a response, but in this way, at least, they avoid reactivating the contradiction.

The creations of the players are various, and they have been used for more than 5 minutes
    concluding remarks  
I have a loyal fan of "Baoke dream" series around me. He can't accept gf's decision. At first, he was also immersed in the joy of the new work's release like other Baoke dream fans. Earlier, he even couldn't get to sleep because the game trailer didn't announce the release date. Now, he even has the idea of buying second-hand products so as not to contribute to gf's sales Before the formation of a strong contrast. Most fans hold the same idea, and plan to let the sales volume of the new work die suddenly, which will make GF suffer a little. In my opinion, these are meaningless actions, and what should be bought will still be bought at that time.

We don't know how to plan and view the IP within GF, but it seems that the voice of players can't shake its decision. I remember that GF has been insisting on making baokemeng become the real partner of players for many years, not just a series of cold data. Now in the new work, we may not even see baokemeng, who once took risks with us. How can we say that? I hope GF can respond to the call of players. If we continue to shut up like this, even the "God IP" will fall to the altar one day.
