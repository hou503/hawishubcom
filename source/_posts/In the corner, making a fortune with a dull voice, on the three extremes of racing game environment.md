Nowadays, there are not a few people who like cars. Cars can be used as a substitute for people's daily travel, or as "large toys" for some enthusiasts' entertainment. This circle is not small, but it is estimated that the former accounts for much more than the latter. For some reasons, there are quite a few people who can't reach the existence of such a large-scale machinery as automobiles, so video games have become the best alternative. However, it's not known that in the circle of video games, speed games may be the existence with the lowest degree of discussion and enthusiasm. You may have seen a famous anchor who doesn't take the initiative to play a competition with the purpose of just eating Speed game? This alone is enough to prove the claim.

However, in fact, even though car games are a relatively small circle, they are always an indispensable category in the game market. The innovation of car games is not only to adjust the taste of players, but also represents the highest image quality of the current generation of hardware performance. Today's racing games are mainly divided into three groups, and these three groups almost include all the current mainstream platforms, and the benefits they can bring to the game companies are definitely a force that cannot be underestimated.

# mobile platform
Although for a long time mobile games have been very unpopular with PC players and host players, there is no doubt that the number of players in the mobile game field may be several times that of these players, which is an extremely huge market. For the racing games, it may be able to get stable income guarantee on this platform. At first, the design of the mobile end of the racing game was very immature, which was largely improved by the intervention of some first-line manufacturers. I vaguely remember a friend a long time ago who asked the seller the first question when he changed his mobile phone: "can this mobile phone smoothly run" the best flying car 17 " This shows that the performance of this game in the mobile platform is quite excellent, not only has a good sense of operation, but also compared with other works in the same period in terms of the performance of the screen, it is the existence of big brother level.

"The best flying car: the most wanted" mobile edition
There are two oligarchs in the mobile platform's racing game, one is called CSR racing, and the other is the wild racing, which is well known by the domestic players. Both of them are popular in the global market. Apart from these large-scale production of racing works, there are also domestic mainstream online racing games such as "running kart", "QQ flying car". The original PC versions of these games have been in operation for more than ten years now. No matter how excellent the operation of this game is, its popularity is certainly not as good as it was at the beginning. Its own games The picture quality and game configuration of is not hard for the current mobile platform, so moving it to the mobile platform may be a good way to continue the popularity of the game and expand the group of players. The performance of these games on the mobile platform is also quite excellent. Their own games focus on social, and social is just the strength of the mobile platform.

# host and PC
Generally, most of the racing players on the host platform and PC platform are light players. They need simple and direct game fun. If the content of the game itself is less or the playing method is relatively simple, they are likely to encounter a cold situation. In most cases, especially in the domestic game environment, players tend to be passionate and enthusiastic in American style, and pay attention to a cool driving style. The reason for this is largely related to the early Chinese market deeply influenced by the classic flying car. The classic flying car series mainly focuses on the crisp street racing, and many works involve the police Bandit conflict can bring the most intuitive sensory impact to the players. At the same time, the "best flying car" series also has the official authorization of many well-known car factories, allowing the players to drive the vehicles that can be seen in film and television programs or display life in the game, which is often the vehicles that can meet the greatest needs of the players.

The best car 19
Then, because of the invariability of the series, the players gradually lost interest in the series. As one of EA's new year's products, the series seems to have some general meaning. This gives other competitors the opportunity to enter. At present, the most popular race game on PC and host platform is Microsoft's "extreme race" series. Whether it's the true racing car or the open world race "Horizon" with the nature of external transmission, it has a very good performance. This series of works has become the first in the industry today, thanks to its constant updating and iteration throughout the year, so as to ensure the high quality of the game in the long run. Unlike other works, which are always trying to break through the theme and content, each generation of works is a new start and redevelopment, and its completion will be easily compared.

# hardcore players
For the core players of racing games, they are not so much like racing games as they really like car sports. They will be more inclined to imitate the real racing games, and the more realistic the better the works. They are willing to repeatedly debug their favorite vehicles in these high fidelity racing games, hone their driving skills bit by bit, keep in mind the structure of each track, and strive to make their racing time be able to be rushed into the ranking. Most of these games are based on professional racing themes, such as dust, racing plan, and godly KOSHA, which are especially popular with these players. Usually these games also contain very detailed vehicle adjustment system, and have relatively excellent physical effects and picture performance. The theoretical stimulation degree may be far less than those semi real works In the eyes of outsiders, these games can't be played by ordinary people at all. It's not only difficult to start with complicated systems, but also necessary to invest in high-cost purchase of special peripherals. The entry threshold alone is enough to persuade a large number of players.

Racing plan 2
If the pseudo real racing game is upgraded to another level, these works cannot be called racing games, but are called "driving simulators", and the experience process is also called "simulated racing". Simulation car racing usually has a set of relatively strict rules and systems, and has a relatively perfect training process. To fully understand and master these contents, it needs to invest a considerable amount of time to learn and practice. In essence, it is not much different from the real car racing in reality, just because it is sitting in front of the screen, so it is better than the real car racing There is a lot of safety, and now there are many car clubs and teams are also using this way to train drivers, which is a huge income for developers.

    concluding remarks  
Different from other kinds of games, what developers need to do is just to create excellent pictures and good physical effects as much as possible. In essence, they just compete with each other on whose speed is faster and whose technology is better. If "walking" in other games is an operation that can be easily executed without brain thinking, then the racing game is toâ€œ The process of "walking" is complicated. Players only need to think about how to make their cars run faster. No matter what theme or mode, the core idea can never be changed. No matter what platform has a solid support and fans, which may be one of the reasons why racing games can flourish forever. Perhaps only a small number of people can realize and understand this fast-paced pleasure at present, but it should be known by more people, and it's a pity to be a small game for it.
