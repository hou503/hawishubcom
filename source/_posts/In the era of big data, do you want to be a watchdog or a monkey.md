With the rapid development of science and technology, people's lives become more efficient and convenient relying on a variety of high-tech digital products. Basically, everyone will have a virtual file on the Internet to use the functions of various service-oriented software. The world's leading management consulting company once said that: data has penetrated into every industry and business function field and become an important production factor. People's mining and application of massive data indicates the arrival of a new wave of productivity growth and consumer surplus, and this wave is known as the "big data era".

But have you ever thought that in such an era, our personal information can still be safe and confidential? Not only have you ever had the experience of adding a shopping cart when you see the desired product on the Internet, but also when you hesitate to buy it, and then you turn off the web page and open other apps, resulting in a huge advertisement in front of you, which is the product you just added to the shopping cart. Or they often receive calls from people who don't know where they are from, and the content of these calls is often to promote products or businesses. I don't know if you think like this: how do they know my information? In view of this situation, many artists have expressed their opinions and understandings in different forms, among which, of course, games are indispensable.
#  "primate watch club"
In October 2018, a game development team from Spain, fictiorama studios, brought us a game called do not feed the monkeys. At first glance, anyone who listens to the game with a very strange name will think it is a simulated nurturing game. However, the actual content and playing method of the game are very bad. First of all, we can be sure that there are no monkeys in this game, but when you have a deep understanding of this game, you will have a feeling of "it seems that it's OK to call it this way".

What kind of game is this? I don't know how to define it. According to the introduction of the game, he calls himself "peeping Simulator". In the game, the player will play the role of an ordinary citizen living in a rental apartment. A netizen invited the protagonist to join a private club. The activity content of the club is to observe people or things from all over the world through a variety of security cameras or webcams through a software. The club calls each monitoring window "cage", while the people in the monitoring room are It is called "primate", that is, "monkey". There are two rules in the club: no interaction with primates and no feeding of monkeys. In short, the club gives you the right to peek at others, but you must not directly contact with the people under surveillance or send things to the people under surveillance.

The so-called "the unreachable are always in turmoil" is that under such a condition, people will be more curious about what will happen if they contact with "monkeys". In the game, players need to work to maintain their own livelihood. It is necessary to eat and sleep. Next, sitting in front of the computer and watching "monkey". We can collect some information through the words of "monkey". By integrating these information and searching on the Internet, we can find out who the observed people are, what they are doing and what secrets they have. With the information in our hands, we can easily accomplish certain things, such as we can threaten some people who do things harmful to the nature to make profits, or help some people who have difficulties and need help, but this means that we, as a stranger, interfere with other people's original life, and we need to remember to abide by the rules of the club, or we will play over.

Everyone has a secret. For example, this politician is a polite politician in the daytime, and he becomes a woman in the middle of the night
The mode of the whole game is very similar to the movie "the back window", which was released on August 1, 1954. The protagonist of the movie spies and collects information every day to detect a murder. The same is true in "don't feed the monkey". However, each "cage" does not interfere with each other, but most cages have some strange time If it happens, players can track it if they are interested, and if they don't do anything, it won't have any impact. The idea of the game is to give the player the right to choose all things, and let the player know and judge by himself. There is no doubt that peeping into other people's life is a very exciting thing, but more often it is the player's conscience that is tested.

You can buy something for "the man in the cage", which is "feed the monkey"
#  "watchdog"
In March 2018, Britain and the United States reported that a data analysis company called "Cambridge analysis" collected more than 50 million user data through a psychological quiz developed for Facebook platform, and then used the data to control the 2016 US presidential election. This news burst out, immediately triggered social controversy, which means that all people's daily actions on the Internet are recorded and analyzed. This event makes many people feel creepy, which means that the network environment we usually rely on is not safe.

What websites to watch, what to like and whether to fast forward videos will become the data of character judgment
In the game "watchdog", we have built a world of big data era for us. In order to enjoy the convenient life conveniently and quickly, all people's information has been uploaded to the same network CTOs, which means that if the system is not secure, everyone's life will be snooped and controlled, and people's information will be commercialized for profit ; and if the network administrator is malicious, the same situation will happen. Everyone is in a state of being monitored, with no privacy or freedom to speak of.
In the game, we can see that, in fact, people's life has become more relaxed and convenient because of CTOs, but it seems that the whole city has no vitality and vitality to speak of. You can't feel the happy atmosphere because of the convenient life. For these citizens who don't understand, it seems that they deserve it.

With the help of the hacker organization dedsec, the protagonist of the game achieves his own goal, while the darkest part of CTOs is exposed in front of people. People protested and tried to find relevant departments for a statement. From here we can see that the citizens have been kept in the dark for a long time. Although we know that the original intention of CTOs is good, and its purpose is to serve people's lives, it is inevitable that there will be some outlaws making profits from it.
The name of the game is watch dog, which is a proper term in computer science. It refers to a unit used to supervise the chip situation of computer single-chip microcomputer. The city in the game is like a huge single-chip microcomputer, and the hacker organization is like this "watch dog". It is their existence that makes people realize that information is big The drawback of unity. Even the managers of the world need a watcher to pay attention to them. Otherwise, if they commit crimes that day, who can stop them?

    concluding remarks  
From different games, we can know the experience and mentality of "Observer" and "observed" from different perspectives. After comparing with reality, we can easily come to the conclusion that the era of big data is like a double-edged sword. While bringing us great convenience in production and life, some seemingly inadvertent things are slowly changing us Life. Since technology is advancing, people's thoughts and consciousness should also be improved. To change people's way of controlling new technology, we should learn to think. In a rapidly changing society, we should master our own cognition, do a good job in privacy protection, and never become a naked "transparent person" in front of data.
