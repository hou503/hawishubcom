In November 2018, at the so-called "video game Oscar" TGA award ceremony, many top-notch 3A players, such as "God of war" and "wilderness Escort: Redemption 2", were nominated for the best game of the year. In this list of nominations, it seems that there is something different in painting style. A platform jumping game with pixel style also appears in this list. It is the only independent game in all works, and its playing method is just platform jumping. Compared with other works, it seems so out of place, making it difficult for people not to pay attention to it. The name of the game is "blue". It's puzzling why the game appears on this list.

# dream host
Before introducing the game "blue", I have to mention another name, pico-8, or "fantasy console". This is a platform that focuses on the development of mini retro games, but it can also be used to play games. The reason why it is called "host" is that the framework design of the development template of this platform is similar to that of the host framework, and the whole platform is also called "host" Its operation style and UI design are very similar to those of the retro game consoles integrating various simulators many years ago, and the official and game developers also call these games "cartridges". When experiencing the client version of this platform, it feels like playing a 10% retro host. It is worth mentioning that this platform can only be used to make 8bit style games, but because it is built with modern technology, even 8-bit pixels can present a very delicate game picture.

Pico-8 home page
Back to the point, Celeste was jointly developed by independent game producers Matt Thorson and Noel berry. Their last work, tower down: rising to the sky, was launched in 2014. In recent years, they seem to have disappeared. And that's one year after tower down: rising to the sky, they spent four days to make a horizontal platform jump game on the "dream host P" pico-8 platform mentioned above, which is the prototype of "blue", which they call "blue classic". Pico-8's "blue classic" can only be described as "simple" with the current vision. The player controls a character who looks like a little girl (because of her long hair) to conquer all levels. In addition to the basic jumping, the protagonist has the ability of "sprinting", which can achieve the effect of rapid displacement in the air, while many levels are floating Strawberries float as a bonus collection.

Green, red and long hair... Huajing hospital, Dianming!?

Although the mechanism of the game is not novel, many levels of the game are well designed. The challenging game settings make this little game quickly become the most popular work on the whole platform. In view of the popularity of the game, the two people who developed this work decided to develop this prototype product into a formal version. They spent nearly three years to develop the game. As pico-8 is no longer used as the carrier, the game's picture, score and scale can be greatly improved, which is the finished product we see now. However, even if the engine with better picture is used, it's hard to say how excellent its performance is as a pixel style game. The characters in the form of pixels in the game even have no face, but this is not important for the game itself. When the players are in the actual operation, they hardly care about the action and appearance of the characters.

The details of the picture are not rich, but they are very eye-catching
There is no fight, few enemies, very smooth operation mechanism and well-designed checkpoints are all part of the game, but it seems not enough for a serious game, so the two people added the plot to the platform jumping game (there is a slight drama below): the main character is a little girl named Madeline, who came to the game alone and named "blue" ‚ÄùShe is suffering from mild depression, so she wants to cure herself by climbing. In this dangerous journey, Madeline will encounter all kinds of roles, non human roles, and even face the dark side of her heart. Although the transition plot in the game only accounts for a small part, most of the time, the game will highlight the mood of the protagonist through various mechanism settings. It has a style of stream of consciousness, which is not very delicate in itself. With the last plot that needs the player's heart to experience, it forms a rather abstract overall style. Most of the time, the game needs to show the player Da's emotions are difficult to express even after players have played.

Fight with your dark side
# invisible platform
For a long time, the number of famous adventure games using platform jumping as the main playing method is not large. I vaguely remember that the last one I saw was Xi, an independent game made by Chinese people. Unlike other platform jumping games, most of the players in the game process of blue are in the air rather than on the ground. In the past platform jump games, there is usually a mechanism: the protagonist of the game can only jump in a single period, rarely two-stage jump, but for platform jump games, two-stage jump is a good and bad setting. Although it can make the player's action more flexible, it is easy to reduce the difficulty of the game, especially for some games with For the works of deciphering elements, it will undoubtedly make developers bother to design "invalidation" of the level setting, so in order to avoid this problem, although the game contains two-stage jump, it can only be triggered under certain conditions, such as the pink enemy in "teacup head" and the lantern in "Xi".

Xi
But "blue" added the mechanism of "sprint" in an ingenious way. The player can realize the short-term and rapid displacement in eight directions in the air, which enables the player to decide when to trigger the effect similar to the two-stage jump. Players can only use sprint once in the air and recover after landing. Sometimes players can refresh the sprint effect in the air by touching the "light ball", so as to achieve the effect of "multi jump" to cross many impossible environments. Some people may ask if this is not the same as the effect of multi jump in peacetime? Isn't that meaningless? After playing or watching this game, you will find that almost all the scenes in the game are designed around the unique mechanism of blue. In order to maximize the effect of this mechanism, there is a situation that "most of the time is in the air rather than on the ground". You can regard the position of each sprint as an "invisible" situation And this point is more obvious in the later stage of high difficulty.

There will be fewer and fewer footholds until there is no
    concluding remarks  
Excellent operation handle and mechanism, integrated soundtrack, and quite stream of consciousness plot make this game successful, making it the first full score game in 2018. Relying on the creativity of the producer in design, this game type that has not been favored for many years has been reborn. But the author never said that this game is worth everyone's experience. Even if it's excellent, it's still a very difficult platform jumping game, which is not suitable for everyone. It's only suitable for the players who have certain confidence in their own operation technology. Although there's a mindless "auxiliary mode" in the game, it will undoubtedly reduce the fun of the game by more than half.

It's worth mentioning that Matt, the game producer, is also a Nintendo fan. He also made many Mario maps with "blue wind" in "Super Mario manufacturing 2". Interested players can try it.
