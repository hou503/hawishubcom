In addition, in the game, most of the warrior units give attention to both output and defense, and only by their own strength can they compete with many systems. Here, the nine warrior line-up routine introduced to you is the most simple and direct, but the most powerful, extreme reckless player.
# analysis of lineup company

Warrior company carry: Warrior units can get extra armor, 4 extra armor for 3 warriors, 122 extra armor for 6 Warriors, and 24 extra armor for 9 warriors.
In the normal match, the flow of fighters usually chooses 6 fighters as the core of the lineup, so it is usually the peak period of the battle in the later 8 population. In this period, the lineup of the dominant players is basically formed, and the combat ability is strong. Considering the blood line problem of the inferior players, most of them will choose to die in this period. If they can't eat chickens, they also need to ensure that the minimum insurance doesn't deduct points, so they rely on 6 fighters The core of the lineup with other strong company carrying effect is the most common routine in the current warrior flow. However, what I'm going to introduce here is the team system of the nine soldiers' reckless flow, which is to go all the way to the end, and to crush the enemy from the front by relying on the powerful armor effect and the quality of chess pieces, so that the players can enjoy different pleasure and pleasure. The core of the nine soldiers is the high bonus of full level 24 point armor. All units can enjoy the bonus. When facing the lineup with physical flow output as the main output, such as sniper flow, assassin flow and other lineups, they can occupy a very favorable battlefield advantage. However, in the face of master blasting flow, the role of armor will be infinitely reduced, so it is the best to respond flexibly according to the actual situation The upper part of the thinking.

In fact, in the later stage, most of the pieces will become cannon fodder, which will pull out output space for a few core pieces. Among them, the most critical pieces are the two units of sword slave and sword slave.
Sabre slave passive skill effect: 20% chance to trigger critical hit when attacking, 1 star 300%, 2 star 450%, 3 star 600. Every star level promotion can bring a qualitative change to daonu. In the middle and later stages of the game, with the bonus of soldiers' company carrying extra armor, daonu's DPS ability will become stronger and stronger. Sanxing daonu is the strongest guarantee for players to eat chicken.

As shown in the figure, in the later stage of cosmetic shaping, the damage of 2-star Sabre slaves will have been eliminated. If they are combined with blood sucking clothes, they will almost have the strength of one carry in the later stage. The best point of another core unit, JianNu, is that chess skills can cause high AoE damage. The more powerful the later stage is, and during the release of skills, JianNu will gain The effect of immune control and skill damage. When the warrior flow encounters the skill damage based lineup such as spell flow in the later period, the sword slave will become the strongest core of the team.
# practical thinking and operation process

Early goal: three soldiers + two beasts or two puppets.
Warrior flow has a total of 10 pieces in the game, and is evenly distributed among low, medium and high fees. In the game, it is almost impossible to jam hands, and the operation is simple. For some players with dark faces, warrior flow is a very good top-down lineup system. In the early stage, because the giant toothed elephant and the fierce poisonous beast belong to the beast warrior, they can form three battle pairs at the minimum population of 3 The combination of beasts is very powerful, while the sword slave and the sword slave belong to the same puppet warrior. Even in the early stage, they can be matched with axe slave and other pieces to form a double puppet company. For the warrior flow, almost all pieces can be matched, including assassins, mages, guards, auxiliary, etc. if you always feel bad luck and have nothing to do in the early stage, then come Play warrior, and don't worry about the frequent occurrence of early hand jams.

In the mid-term, there is no doubt that the six warriors will be our most important goal. The three warriors can only increase their armor by 4 points, which has a very common effect. However, the six warriors' armor has been increased to 12 points directly. In the mid-term, the large-scale recruit team system, which mainly focuses on skill damage, is still in a semi formed state. At this time, the main body of damage is still physical output, so the armor company carrying effect of the six Warriors Fruit promotion is very large, once formed, it can almost establish the dominant position in the middle period, without fear of any playing system.
In addition, when the population is 7, it can be matched with a fire dance or nakelu to form a double combatant family to further improve the team's output ability. However, if you are not lucky enough in the early stage, you can also match with some other powerful single cards, such as the output of Lei Zhenzi in the back row, the front row anti armour killing bee, AoE damage electric Jiao, etc. the compatibility of 6 fighters is very strong Almost fearless. In the mid-term, we rely on the transition of powerful chess pieces to accumulate economy and prepare for the later 9 population.

In the later stage, once the 9 soldiers are formed, the physical defense ability can reach the peak. However, if we want to eat chicken, Samsung pieces will become our biggest help. It is suggested that Samsung ideas, the core output of sword slaves is the highest priority, followed by 1-star low-cost pieces, Samsung is relatively low in difficulty, and 4-fee and above pieces are all suggested that 2-star is enough, high-cost pieces are too difficult It's very easy to hold the rhythm, and the core of warrior flow, sword slave and sword slave, are chess pieces of 2 or 3 fees. Samsung's role is also higher, so taking this as the goal, the probability of eating chicken is higher.
