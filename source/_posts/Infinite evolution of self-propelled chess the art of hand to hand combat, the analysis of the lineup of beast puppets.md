In the infinite evolution of self-propelled chess, when it comes to hand to hand combat, I believe that the first unit you think of is the warrior unit, but in fact, in addition to the warrior, the beast, guard, puppet and other units also have a strong hand to hand combat ability, and each has its own characteristics. The warrior has armor bonus, the beast can bring extra attack speed, and the guard can get a strong shield effect, puppet Puppets can enjoy a high attack bonus.
Here, we will bring you a set of analysis of the beast puppet flow lineup, which depends on the powerful output effect of the puppet unit and the total attack speed bonus of the beast flow. In terms of hand combat, the overall output strength is even higher than the warrior flow.
#  analysis of lineup's combination and collocation
Let's first look at the core of the lineup system.

Beast company with:   2 beast increases attack speed of its own beast unit by 10%, 4 beast increases attack speed of all allies by 25%, 6 beast increases attack speed of all allies by 60%.

Puppet company carrying:   2 when puppet, increase the attack power of your puppet unit by 10%, 4 when puppet, increase the attack power of your puppet unit by 30%, 6 when puppet, increase the attack power of all your units by 55%.
The attack power and attack speed are the most important output factors for physical output, and the beast and puppet company meet these two points. However, it's a little pity that the beast and puppet are racial positioning, so there is no beast puppet attribute in the game, so the lineup of 6 beast and 6 puppet is almost impossible in the game To achieve this, however, we need to take the second place. 25% of the attack speed bonus of all 4 beasts and 30% of the attack speed bonus of 4 puppets can already bring enough powerful output to the team. Therefore, the most important point for the beast puppet flow is actually the choice of the core chess pieces.

Four wild animals match recommendation: giant tooth elephant, ferocious poisonous animal, longevity deer, blood eagle.
Two cheap beasts, two expensive beasts. It's easy for Samsung with low cost, and it's difficult to start at the early stage. It's very suitable for filling the role of the current platoon tank. Moreover, both the giant tooth elephant and the fierce poisonous beast are positioned by the beast warrior. They can form a warrior company with the sword slave and the sword slave in the puppet to further improve the combat ability of the lineup. The high star chess pieces recommend to assist the beast longevity deer and the battle core blood eagle to improve the quality of the mid late lineup.

Four puppet match recommendations: Axe slave, sword slave, sword slave, shield slave.
The core of the output of the beast puppet flow lies in the two brothers, sword slave and sword slave. The attack speed bonus of the beast company and the attack power bonus of the puppet company serve the two units. Moreover, the two brothers belong to the warrior profession at the same time. Under the bonus of the Warrior armor, they are more powerful in the later period. The other two puppet units recommend axe slave and shield slave. Axe slave has the advantages of low cost and easy access to stars. As an assassin unit, it can directly cut into the enemy's back row without crowding together. As an output role of AOE in the front row, shield slave can resist and fight, and later two stars can have strong strength.
# operation process and actual combat details

Early goal: two beasts and three soldiers. The most ideal configuration is giant toothed elephant, fierce poisonous beast and sword slave. The three units can join hands. Although sword slave has been weakened to a certain extent in the near future, it is still a very powerful card from the current actual combat effect. Especially in the early stage, if two-star sword slave can be started early, then the first half of the whole competition will be safe.

Second stage goal: 4 beast 4 puppet 4 warrior.
Different from the beast war, the beast puppet flow does not need to pursue the effect of six battles. It uses the beast pieces as the front row of the team and relies on the puppet units for output. However, relatively speaking, the overall strong team of the lineup has a high dependence on the quality of the flags. If we can start with three-star sword slaves or sword slaves, it may be very simple to win in a row and eat chicken. If there are only two-star pieces, Then it may depend on the specific situation of the actual opponent. If there are more than one chess piece on the 8 population field, then it has basically gone far. Therefore, it must be remembered that for the beast puppet flow, the star level of the chess pieces is very important. Don't pursue the high cost chess pieces too much. Take the low cost as the main combat power, and judge whether you need to search the cards to improve the combat power according to the actual situation of the blood volume.

In the later stage, it's the only goal to find Sanxing to eat chicken. We recommend Sanxing as the priority. JianNu = daonu > ferocious beast > others. Swords and slaves are the core of the lineup, and Samsung chess is a strong guarantee to eat chicken. Therefore, in the middle and late stage of the game, Samsung swords will always be the first choice of the lineup system. Secondly, it is recommended to pursue the three-star fierce poison beast. The sword output requires the front row unit to pull space. Therefore, the three-star priority of the giant tooth elephant and the fierce poison beast is also very high. However, the giant tooth elephant's three-star income is not very large. If the grid is not enough in the later period, two stars can make do with it instead of forcing the three-star, but the fierce poison beast is not the same. The three-star fierce poison beast skill armor reduction effect can be obtained With the improvement of quality and the physical output of sword, it can quickly kill the injured characters in the front row of the enemy, improve the overall output ability of the team in the later stage, which is very obvious, and try to ensure Samsung. However, other units are either not significantly improved, or the cost is too expensive, and later Samsung is more difficult.
Compared with the beast war, the beast puppet stream abandoned the high armor bonus of the 6th battle, and turned to pursue the high attack speed of the beast and the high attack power bonus of the puppet. The actual combat effect of the beast puppet is believed to be better when it comes to the output ability of hand to hand combat.
