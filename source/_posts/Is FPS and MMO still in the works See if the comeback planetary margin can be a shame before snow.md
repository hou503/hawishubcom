I'm half a sci-fi fan. I like both space theme and future war movies and TV works very much. I met the first sci-fi FPS game "Battlefield 2142" in my life under a friend's Amway. As a derivative and sequel of the battlefield series, 2142 has a very good battlefield atmosphere and a variety of advanced weapons and vehicles for use in the game. In that era when piracy was rampant in China, even the man-machine sitting in front of the computer for a day enjoyed it. Battlefield 2142 is a competitive FPS combining science fiction and battlefield, which has been exposed in the players' field of vision to the greatest extent. It has become the enlightenment work of many players for this kind of game. At the same time, it has its own excellent quality. Although its influence is not as good as the battlefield series, it is also a good work.

When I was in high school, I happened to see an online game advertisement, which was also a science fiction FPS, and claimed that the game was similar to Battlefield 2142, but its scale was several times larger. When I saw this sentence, I was immediately interested in it, and then I searched for the game called Xingxing marginal 2 on the Internet. After a period of time, addicted to them, and then because no friends to play with the pit, never again on the line.
When we heard the name of "planetary margin" again, the national service of the game had been stopped. Until recently, the development team of the game finally determined the production plan of the sequel "planetary edge 3", which made fans like me finally see the hope again.

Speaking of Sony online entertainment (SOE for short), many players may feel strange and familiar. This is a branch of Sony that has been focusing on the research and development of online games since its establishment. Its representative, endless tasks, as the originator of 3dmmorpg online games, achieved great success and influence at that time, both at home and abroad Loud force.
It's not long after entering the 21st century. It's also the most popular time for many people to fight FPS. Famous works such as anti terrorist elite and Legion fortress are very popular. SOE wants to develop a competitive FPS with multiple people. Considering that it has experience in developing MMO games, SOE doesn't plan to make a similar FPS For the small map confrontation like s, we need to make it bigger. Simply let hundreds of people play on one map at the same time. There is no so-called score of innings. Just like a real war, when can we occupy the whole map and end it, and then start the next round of war. This is mmofps, SOE named this game during the period of the great redã€Š Planetside, translated as "interstellar online" by Chinese agent.

Planet side
There is no clear division of labor in star ol, but there are different factions. The characters controlled by players are like a piece of white paper. You can draw as you like. You can be a fighter pilot or a tank hand, or a heavy fire infantry with a missile and a thunder. The weapon configuration can be selected at will in the game. This height is self-contained The design of the definition requires the player's "RP spirit" to a great extent. After all, this is a battlefield, and different players need to share different work and implement tactics to cooperate with each other, so that they can fight with the enemy most efficiently. The goal is to kill other players in the battalions against your enemy, and carry out a long-lasting territory on a huge map that can hold 300 people Fight for.
Although the game was not famous compared with other FPS at first, it still gained a lot of fans with its super large-scale combat mode and super highly customized game playing method. After all, at that time, science fiction players were still easy to find.

On the top of the road
Of course, although this game is very fun, there are many problems. In most of the game processes, players spend half of their time to rush from the resurrection point to the fighting place. In view of the huge map, it may take a lot of time. At the same time, as an MMO game, because the game rhythm is slow, there is no time and the setting of compulsory participation in the war, the players can wander and explore in the game map at will outside the battle, but outside the battle, the game has almost no playability, nothing more than talking with other players of our members, and drawing a few simple actions for interaction.
In the nearly 13 years of operation, SOE has only launched four major version updates for this game. The slow update frequency and the playability that can't be enhanced all the time are undoubtedly fatal for an online game. SOE naturally knows how the performance of this game is and where the problem is. But at this time, the development of electronic games has entered a high-speed era, and its expansion The repair and update of the flag and drum is not as direct as the development of a new work. So the development and opinion collection of the sequel started by SOE. As for interstellar ol, it depends on how long life can live.

At the E3 game exhibition a year ago, when star OL was out of service, SOE released the game preview of planet edge 2. This time, the game was built with a new engine, and the scale of the battlefield was expanded from 300 to 2000. For those players who had played before, it felt like "hey, I can't do it". At that time, the whole game industry also paid high attention to this game, and the media also praised the achievement of SOE this time. Many players wanted to experience it in the "big battlefield".
However, in the era of information development, the mainstream players were not the old players who played the previous games, but a new group of new players who played various fast-paced games. For the game of "planetary edge 2", they could only use the form of "confused". They thought it was like "anti terrorist elite", but they just made the scale of thousands of people At the meeting, the change of the world is driven by players like MMO games, and many people can't adapt to this slower game mode, so the number of players in the game fluctuates greatly for a period of time. First, a large number of players rush into the game, and then only some loyal fans and old players are still insisting, and the total number of these players is less than one million.

Planetary margin 2
Planetary edge 2 is represented by the ninth city on the mainland. It is believed that a large number of players have heard about the company before they contact the company, and the company's main business is not online games. The content of "planetary edge 2" represented by the ninth city is basically the same as that of the international service, but the price of some props in the game is much more expensive than that of the international service. At the same time, there are many bugs in the game when it is launched, and the official has been trying to fix them, while the national service will not push an update for a long time, and even the update is extremely rare Repair Bug. As a game of setting up servers in China, it seems that the scale of 2000 people in the same picture is a little overloaded for Jiucheng. Therefore, in most of the time, there is a rare phenomenon that national service is more difficult to log in than international service.
Expensive game props, coupled with mindless game experience, even though Jiucheng has spent a lot of energy on the promotion of the game, it still can't save the situation that the players are always losing. Obviously, they didn't do their work where they should. On the other hand, SOE is also busy developing a zombie themed eschatological survival game, which is the familiar h1z1, so it largely ignores the operation and maintenance of planetary edge 2.

Planetary margin: Arena
"Planetary margin 2" came to an early end in the national service, largely because of the agency's inattention and inaction, while the international service has been active for a long time. But as time goes by, this game mode is no longer popular, and as time goes by, this game has gradually lost its popularity. Even though it has created excellent reputation, there are still many problems in the game itself that need to be modified, and these problems are exactly the reason why this type of game can not receive the attention of players at present. Currently, the SOE that left Sony changed its name to daybreak games, and brought the derivative work "planetary edge: arena" for transition. Soon, planetary edge 3 will be developed, hoping that this time they can learn from the previous failure and succeed in shining again in the current game market. After all, this game is really fun.
