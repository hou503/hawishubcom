Recently, an animation called "no guns life" has attracted my attention. In this animation, many people have received different degrees of mechanical transformation due to various reasons, some are part of the body, some are the whole body, even the main character's head is a left-handed gun, and these people are called "expansionists" " But even if everyone has mechanical transformation, it doesn't make everyone have a better life. This high-tech low life setting is like cyberpunk, but it's far from the taste of cyberpunk.

Not to mention the reputation of animation, at least I am very interested in this theme, and watching this animation always reminds me of a game called "ruiner", although the styles of the two are quite different, and the latter has a more strong cyberpunk flavor, which always gives me a very similar feeling. When it comes to cyberpunk, some people will suddenly think of the upcoming release of "cyberpunk 2077" in Polish CD project red next year. Coincidentally, this "ruiner" is also made by a group of poles, but it has created a different cyberpunk world.

Enlighten      
When I first saw this game at E3 game show in 2017, it's hard not to associate it with another classic, Miami hotline, because the publisher of "ruiner" is devolver, an independent game giant, and "ruiner" is an action shooting game overlooking the corner. The protagonist is wearing a leather jacket, a mask, and a variety of guns and weapons Killing Sifang is as manic as devolver's previous games, but it seems to give people a feeling of "the game should be cool".
Some people may not believe that such an irascible game is actually made by a woman, Magdalena tomkowicz (hereinafter referred to as MT). She is a journalist, but somehow later joined the game industry, and once really worked in the cdpr of "Polish donkey", and the reason for her to engage in the game industry is purely because of her childhood passion for games Love and a cavity of their own blood, who can think of doing so has been insisting on doing down.

The protagonist's style and grumpiness are all written on his face
It was almost the same opportunity as other independent game studios when they were founded. At the time of cdpr's inauguration, MT saw her company develop a little bit, but MAG still felt that she couldn't accept the rules and restrictions of large companies. As employees, they didn't have the opportunity to do what she really liked, so she left cdpr with her husband and set up reikon games studio.
Even if they choose to do something with their own thoughts, they are confused when they let themselves play at will. Their only inspiration is the classic sci-fi film "blade killer" released in the early years. The members of the studio like the close and dreamlike cyberpunk style in the film, but they don't think they are that You know about cyberpunk, if you choose this style rashly, the final product may be questioned by the players, so they choose to use the cyberpunk elements on the surface of the game as much as possible, without deep-seated content, so in their view, in fact, this game is not a cyberpunk game.

Blade killer
# violence against violence
In fact, although "ruiner" looks like "Miami hotline", in fact, the game type selection of "ruiner" is influenced by "Miami hotline". It is also a fast-paced downward looking angle shooting, but it is not as hard core as "Miami hotline". As mentioned above, the protagonist controlled by the player can kill all sides with all kinds of weapons, but if it's so simple, it's a bit monotonous, so the importance of setting is reflected.
There is a big word "brother" written on the back of the protagonist's leather coat. You don't know what you should do or where you should go. The protagonist met a hacker beauty by chance. All the targets and actions of the protagonist were designated by the woman. The woman didn't know why she wanted to help the protagonist, and said that the protagonist's brother was kidnapped. The woman can To guide the protagonist to save his own brother.

Early character set
The protagonist doesn't say a word, but he can clearly show his emotions on his mask, so that others can't see his face, but they can know his mood, which is one of the core of the game design ideas: MT wants to create a protagonist image that even the players themselves will feel some fear, put the mask on him and don't explain this clearly People's life experience can increase the mystery of the protagonist, and the design of only killing can make the player feel that the protagonist is very cold and ferocious.
The whole game uses bright red and black to set off the brutal game atmosphere in the game, and integrates many very common settings in cyberpunk, such as high-tech low life, gangs and prostitutes everywhere, street buildings like downtown Tokyo, as well as the Hong Kong Style scenes and signs that can be seen everywhere, and the American style unrestrained atmosphere Rich, but the illustration and vertical painting are all Japanese style, these very iconic symbols can only appear in anyone's mind four words:   cyberpunk  .

Most of the female characters in the game are basically in this style
Based on the above two concepts, a unique effect is formed that everything in the game is eye-catching, but only a small part of the content can be remembered by the players. Even when talking with NPC, most of them only have two options of "nod" and "shrug". The players don't need to think too much about how to choose, only "yes" and "I don't care" ‚ÄùTwo kinds of expressions enable the player to enter the same state as the protagonist, only need to know where to go and who to kill. The player can pay more attention to the fighting system of the game, and the story of the game itself has never risen to the level of discussion on human nature of cyberpunk in the past.
Different from Miami hot line, the protagonist and the enemy in the game are not necessarily killed in one shot, and the protagonist can use a variety of skills, such as the most basic "bullet time" and fast Dodge, which can enable the protagonist to come and go freely in the battle, or improve the defense and attack power without brain and hard encounter with the enemy, have talent tree and reset skill points at any time Enter, as for which way to fight, it depends on the player's mood.

At the same time, the angle of view is 45, so the hands need to adapt
    concluding remarks  
It's worth mentioning that little sister hacker will give you evaluation in every battle. When you lose, she will also give you a hint of Yan characters to calm the frustration of the players. It can be said that she understands the ideas of the players very well. However, some people say that the process of the game is a little short. In fact, such a game is not recommended to be played for a long time.

Why "ruiner" is very similar to "non gun life" is mainly because they all have a very representative symbol of cyberpunk, but they only touch the iceberg corner of cyberpunk, and they are particularly inclined to the hardline style in the atmosphere shaping. "Non gun" tells an alternative story from a relatively unique perspective, which is thought-provoking, compared with "Ruiner" is just to let the players let go of all the unhappiness in the game and let out.
