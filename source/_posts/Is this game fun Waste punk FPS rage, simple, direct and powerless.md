Back eight years ago, it was a time when the best single player game was in full swing. The Ezio trilogy of Assassin's Creed and the trilogy of call of Duty: modern war were completed. The mysterious sea area ushered in a new chapter of the legend, and the birth of the masterpiece ancient scroll 5. In front of such a luxurious lineup, for an original new work, if there is no eye-catching flash point, it is difficult to stand out from it. There are many victims buried by the best works, and the fury produced by id software is undoubtedly the most impressive one.

In May this year, fury ushered in its sequel after eight years. Because the previous work didn't make much waves at that time, the publisher Bethesda promoted it as a key project. People who are familiar with id software know that their family focuses on producing all kinds of refreshing classic FPS games, and Bethesda also focuses on this point and makes great efforts Potential. There was a time when almost all the game circles were full of advertisements for this game. Many players chose to start with it out of curiosity. After the game was actually released, it didn't seem to meet the expectations of the players.

# waste punk
Speaking of the word "wasteland", it's hard for some qualified players not to think of a post apocalyptic movie called crazy max. if a wasteland game doesn't learn some elements from this movie, it must be lying. Although the game works with the theme of waste land are not new, everyone knows what they are. In fact, there are not too many players who are really interested in it, which is not a special minority type. In this kind of works, RPG game "radiation" series is taken as the representative to create a postwar world full of black humor for the players, but in fact, for the real junkyard fans, it seems that a little punk element is more meaningful. The first generation of rage released in 2011 is such a work. Unlike other games of the same theme, the wasteland of rage is the world destroyed after the earth was hit by an asteroid, rather than the past post-war or virus outbreak, which makes people feel fresh.

In order to continue civilization, human beings have selected a group of elites with outstanding abilities and good genes to join in a plan called "Ark". They are put into a sleeping cabin that can withstand disasters, and can wake up again after the disaster is sad (another "old Popsicle"). After the disaster, the world has not been completely destroyed by asteroids. Some people have survived, some have built settlements to survive together, and some have become lawless vagrants who do evil everywhere. Players will play one of the elites in the "Ark" plan and take risks in this new world. It is worth mentioning that, as a game of 2011, the first generation of "fury" will still make people think that the screen performance of the game is excellent even if it is played now. When the famous media ign's game evaluation and single score were given, it also gave a full score for the screen of the game. Its game body has a capacity of 25g, which was called by many media at that time "Hardware killer".

Thanks to the FPS development experience of id software, the internal score of the game is very meaningful, which can fully experience the pleasure of "shooting and exploding". The weapon is also a combination of science magic wind and waste earth wind. Combined with fast-paced action system and various props, the player can easily play a flowing and gorgeous operation in the game. And since it contains punk elements, how can you not have a cool car like crazy max? The car is an essential thing for players in the game. It can be used as a tool for walking or carrying all kinds of powerful weapons to fight. You can drive it on the waste soil, or you can have a passionate race with other waste customers. From NPC, enemies, and game background, there is a strong smell of junky punk. At present, it can't be a thunder work, but who can expect that id software still messed him up.

   weakness   
The main content of players in the game is to receive tasks, drive, fight and return to hand in tasks. Each task location has been made into a separate linear process area. Some tasks even make you walk the previously passed level again in reverse. The battle of the simple game is better, or the players will be bored soon. John kamak, a talented programmer of id software, once said: FPS is like a small adult movie. The plot can be but is not necessary. Fury has a very perfect story background, but there is almost no sense of existence in the plot performance, and the ending is very hasty. It's like the story suddenly stops in half, and many things are not reasonable Explain that I have some doubts now that John kamak's reason for saying this is probably because they lack the ability to tell a good story. Since they have designed the plot and world view for the game, they should tell a story with a head and a tail, and the unexpected ending makes many players think that it may be just a semi-finished product.

Fury has many problems, but it is undoubtedly a potential stock. If it is revised, it may become a quite excellent game, so the players put this expectation on the sequel. For eight years, fury 2, released this year, publicized the violent aesthetic elements of the game in the early stage of its release, claiming to create a wasteland world as irascible as the name of the game. The main tone of the game is yellow, pink and purple. Combined with its original sci-fi background, the game has a kind of "cyberpunk" flavor in special effects and visual effects. It's like a game called "island crisis: Blood dragon" once made by Ubisoft. People who are used to seeing this visual effect may feel OK, but more people will only think it's like some light pollution.

Fury 2 has changed the game into an open world design for the first time, and it has a new and powerful wasteland world. Unfortunately, this open world is the same as Ubisoft's formula open world. Although it is big, it has no value to explore. The only element that can get a hand in this work is naturally an excellent over head combat system. Thanks to the development of the game, the avalanche studio that makes "self defense" series participates in it. If we simply play it as a "shooting explosion" game like "destroyer", we can get a good experience. For an open world shooting game, only This is obviously not enough. As always, the plot is plain and nonexistent, and the main line flow is short, and the branch line tasks have no impact on the game flow. It seems that rage 2 not only learns the way of formulaic open world in a decent way, but also learns from the plot short board of the next house together with the task design and even the bug.

    concluding remarks  
It seems to have a rigorous world view, but the weak plot design is the game tradition of id software. Even the games like "destroyer" and "German headquarters" have similar problems. The design of "fury" is obviously the head of a hundred families, so it should have a good performance. With its unique crisp fighting, it should not have become a work with poor public praise, Maybe only the players who are interested in the wasteland theme and also like the classic FPS game can enjoy it. If there is one item that can't be satisfied, they are likely to be attracted by the short board in the game, thus leaving a bad impression on the game.
