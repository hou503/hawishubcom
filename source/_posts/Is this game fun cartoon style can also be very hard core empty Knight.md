In the era of 3A games and competitive online games, independent games often give players a lot of surprises and unexpected gains. The reason why independent games are called independent games is that their production cost is low and the volume is not large. The developers may only have a single digit, but they still have very excellent production quality. They do not have those near real top-level pictures, nor those magnificent game scenes. Some of them often only have an excellent story, an eye-catching design, and a It's full of praise and creativity.

In the field of independent game development, due to the limitation of cost and the lack of technical force, independent gamers often only choose 2D screen as the expression form. Some of them like to use the retro pixel style, some like to use the delicate hand-painted style, while in terms of playing methods, they especially like rougelite or Metroid Vania. In recent years, a series of "soul" series works launched by form software have attracted more and more attention of players. Therefore, the game playing method of "soul like" has begun to appear frequently in independent games. If we integrate the 2D hand-painted pictures, the Metroid Vania's playing methods and the "soul like" mechanism, we will get this independent game collection called "empty Knight".
# three for three years
It seems that in the games we usually play or common games, we seldom see games made in Australia. I can often hear friends who have gone to Australia to study abroad say: I thought I could experience the rich game atmosphere of overseas players when I went to Australia, but in fact, none of them particularly like playing games. They prefer sports to playing games And social activities. In Australia, the market of video games is not very good, so there are only a handful of developers and distributors, but a small number of them do not mean that they do not. There are still a group of people who are passionate about games. Team cherry (cherry group) was founded in 2012 by Ali Gibson, William peron and Lohan Fraser. All three are enthusiastic independent gamers with their own strengths. They have participated in game jam (short-term game design, usually need to plan a game in one or two days) held in various places for many times Decent game works), so the three decided to officially establish a studio and become a fixed game development team.

The first three
Unfortunately, Lohan, one of the three, left the studio before the game was approved, and a musician named Christopher Larkin joined the team to fill the gap. Ali is an animator, so he is responsible for most of the art work in the game. William proposed that all the characters in the game should be designed as bugs, so that not only large-scale creation is easy, but also many interesting characters can be easily drawn, just like the animation created in the past. In order to create these insect characters, Ali even needs to spend a period of time observing insects every day. On the other hand, William wants to simply integrate his favorite play method of galactic demon city with "soul like". He enjoys the play method of exploring and challenging in the unknown world. These two themes are completely in line with his taste, while Christopher is responsible for it Most of the music and sound effects in the game were produced. The game was approved in 2014 and initially crowdfunded on the KickStarter platform. It was not completed and listed until 2017.

Design manuscript
#  "spirit of galactic demon city"
Because the characters are all worms, it's hard not to separate from the underground world. In essence, the playing method of empty knight is a 2D horizontal action game. The main character Knight played by the player needs to explore in a huge underground world. Although the cartoon hand painting style of the game is so cute that it doesn't feel like a game developed by a group of old men, the overall color of the game However, Diao reveals a desolate and depressing atmosphere like black soul. One of the major characteristics of Galaxy demon city is that it splices multiple intricate horizontal maps together to form a huge map. The explorable content is distributed in all corners of the map, and the route of each section is designed in all directions. If the back board ability is a little bit poor, the players may be lost playing, which is the excellent performance of map design, although At first glance, it's a bit messy but actually smooth. If you really forget the road, you can find a cartographer to buy a map, but only the places you have explored can be displayed on the map.

The map is only an aid, but more often, you need to fumble for the scene by yourself
As an ARPG game, the combat system of "empty Knight" is very simple and easy to understand, with only one or two attack modes and some mobile moves, so many players will think that the operation of this game is a little simple. In fact, in many horizontal games in the early years, the protagonist often only has one or two attack methods. The main point is that the time of each attack is the more different enemies are faced in the later stage, the more different ways of thinking about the attack will be used. Even if there are only one or two moves, players can still get the pleasure of "insight".

Common attacks are simple, but they are very practical
Although the map design of the game has the flavor of galactic demon city, in fact, its design idea is similar to the series of soul of darkness. Under a 2D plane image, it shows a fairly complete urban system for the players, such as the center of the map is the main city, while other areas such as Tiantai, sewer, station and so on are all around the design of the main city. The players can not Some minor details are observed in the same area to fill in the background of the game, which is simply to create a perfect world first, and then involve the plot and characters in the world.

Many hidden elements need to be felt by players themselves
Some of these production techniques have the meaning of fragmented narration. In his early years, he was used in various immersive simulation games, and then was carried forward by the series of black soul. The map and background design of the game have a high degree of completion, and even the characteristics of enemies in different regions can be explained in the game. And the game itself is not so perfect, the most important point is that the galaxy demon city and the "soul like" game are not particularly simple game types, let alone the "empty Knight" which integrates the two game types. Secondly, due to the high degree of completion in the game world, there are only three people in the development team, which leads to some deficiencies in the design of the game itself in terms of player guidance. Most of the time, players will fall into a state that they don't know what to do and where to go when playing. For players who are used to playing such games, they may still be able to adapt. If they change to be cute new players, 80% of them will be able to adapt Will complain to delete the game.

Boss war that seems simple but needs to be tried again and again
    concluding remarks  
Every independent game with a high degree of completion has no less influence in the whole industry than other 3A masterpieces. The industry usually doesn't care about their technological breakthroughs in the game, but their unique design creativity and obsession in the game. In fact, for the independent game people, developing a game is very important Confused, because they don't know what other players really like, they can't make games that can please the public, so they can only make works that can be considered good games in their own eyes, and in most cases, only games born with this idea as the main purpose are more likely to leave a deep impression for people.

It is worth mentioning that the cherry group announced the news of the sequel "empty Knight: Song of silk" as early as the beginning of this year, but it is still unknown when it can be completed. I hope they can still bring surprises and feelings to the players this time.
