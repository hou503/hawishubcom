Looking at all kinds of popular mobile games nowadays, it is not difficult to find many works adapted based on old classic IP. They may have been popular IP, or they may have been little known cold IP. But it is undeniable that IP adapted mobile games provide a new opportunity for these hot and cold works.
Let's take a closer look at these games. It's not hard to find that these games have very different designs. If we look at the core element of "IP adaptation" from what perspective, what kind of works will be produced. Obviously, the perspective of many manufacturers on the market is about the same position, and the game "Legend of fairyland ro: guarding eternal love" (hereinafter referred to as RO) seems to have some unique views from the beginning.
Nostalgic but not backward
From a long time ago, when large-scale online games began to prevail in the domestic game market, various manufacturers designed different styles of game works for different people. Some people like the magic and realistic style of European and American end tour, some people like the martial arts and immortal style of domestic end tour, and some people like the fresh cartoon style of Japan and South Korea end tour. No matter what the style is, the game system is always biased towards the hard core. Since there is no essential difference in the system, it is necessary to make a judgment from the personal perception. No one has ever said that people who like hard core games will not like the style of cartoon, like is like, there is no limit and no reason.
It's just to see that in RO, all the elements that once carried players' full memories are preserved. No matter the monsters that players have fought with or the partners who have fought with them, they are all reappeared in a more gorgeous 3D form, which neither loses feelings nor makes people feel disconnected from the world.

Most of the large-scale end game IP transplanted to mobile platform will greatly cut down the content of the game in order to adapt to the rhythm of conventional mobile games, and only keep the core part. Although it improves the utilization of player's fragment time, it can't achieve a very good game experience. Old IP fans don't want to enter the pit, and new players don't care about it.
But "ro" didn't compromise the content of the game because of logging into the mobile terminal. Compared with other greatly simplified adapted mobile games, the overall process of RO is relatively slow, and the upgrade process is relatively long. This is the intention of the developers, so that the players can have time to experience the interesting content outside the main line process, so that the players will not feel bored during the adventure process because of the long upgrade process. Perhaps in the eyes of most players, "ro" is not a very friendly game for new players, nor is it particularly easy to find out how to operate the system. It seems that the threshold is very high, but this is not the problem of "ro", but the whole game market in China has been lowered by those over simplified fast-food games, which makes "ro" a high threshold.

The meaning of the game
We all know that playing games is to have fun. Of course, everyone has different ways to have fun. Among the current categories of video games, the most popular is naturally competitive games. As the saying goes, "it's fun to fight with people". In the ordinary domestic mobile games, social elements will be weakened as much as possible. Basically, there is no other social element except a ranking system and an invite friend system. This is because some players like to immerse themselves in the superiority of defeating other players, but in general, players will have strong frustration as long as they fail Feeling, it's OK to win. If you lose again and again, you will angrily delete the game and scold the game rubbish. The player can't experience the fun, and the game itself will also carry the unnecessary scolding. What's the trouble? I always have a point: if a game makes you uncomfortable to play, what's the reason to play it?

Even in MMORPG games, many players often miss the most interesting content of the game in pursuit of utility. They only care about how much reward they can give to complete the task, what advanced equipment they can give, and how to upgrade quickly. But think about it carefully. It seems that no one has stipulated that they must give corresponding experience and Money, no one stipulates to play MMORPG must also become the strongest game.
In RO, the reward of many tasks may be an action, a character expression, a good-looking dress, or the interesting experience deliberately designed by the task itself is the reward for the players. Some people may not understand. What's the point of giving these things? So let's turn the question around: does it have to be meaningful to play games? It's back to the beginning. Isn't it just fun to play games?

Ro's positioning is a leisure MMORPG. Although there are combat systems, skills and occupations that need to be studied with a little attention in the game, they also need to consider themselves according to the style of play, but fighting is not the whole game, and fighting is only moderate and necessary. Players can explore the world at will like a real adventurer in the game. It doesn't matter if they don't fight. There are many interesting contents waiting for players to explore outside the only way of the map. Some people complain about why there is no automatic way finding in the game, and it's very difficult to find a NPC and run on its own. However, many games on the market used to be this way. The reason why there is no such design is to let the players remember the world by themselves, so as to improve the sense of substitution in the game, just like reading novels is spoiled by people, and the sense of freshness will be greatly reduced.

Tail: renew leading edge
"After the test, once depressed can cry, the most real smile can be seen." Every old player of "ro" should be familiar with this "dream sky". For ordinary people, Stefanie Sun, the author of this song, may be just an excellent pop musician. For old players of "ro", she will always be the "music Wizard" in the world of "ro", enriching their youth together with "ro". Considering everything, no matter how classic other elements are, Sun Yanzi, the music wizard, will never be more impressive to the players. So in the RO tour, Sun Yanzi is lucky to return and interact with the players as the music wizard again. After 16 years, players can open a new adventure story with Stefanie Sun and pursue her music growth.

It can be seen that in terms of arousing the memories of the old players, the legend of fairyland ro: guarding the eternal love is a good effort. In general, RO is a pure stream in today's impetuous and materialistic game environment. It's not like a hand game at all. Ro is absolutely excellent in restoring the end game experience. Over the years, developers have been constantly listening to the voice of the players and making appropriate modifications to the game. I sincerely hope that this game can achieve long-term success. After all, there are not many teams who can make a game with such a heart. However, players who have experienced this game carefully should be able to feel it more or less. They really are Making a "game" instead of a "krypton tool".
