In 1984, a researcher from the Soviet Union developed a small game for testing computer performance, but it has an extremely addictive effect. As long as the game does not fail, it can be played continuously. Even many game masters can hardly reveal the reason. They only know that the game can make people play without stopping.

Don't think I'm joking. What kind of fairy game do you think it is? In fact, it's just Tetris that everyone knows. "Tetris" is just a small game, but its sales volume can be said to be quite terrifying. It is called "the game with the highest sales volume in the history of games", and no one has surpassed this title until now.
# kill time
The story happened in the 1980s, when the Soviet Union had not disintegrated. Alexei Pajitnov, a mathematical genius, joined the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. Under the influence of the Soviet government, almost every child had to learn computer since childhood. The purpose was to attract these young people to join the government and become a scientist or an engineer Lexer is one of many people. Alexei's character is relatively straightforward and entertaining. When he is free, he likes to tell a joke with his friends. It's not easy for such a person to do a very boring job repeatedly every day. The work of the research institute is not only boring, but also not spacious. It often requires several people to share a table and a machine, so he often loses things About the West. In order to avoid this situation, Alexei takes the initiative to work overtime in the research institute every day, just for the sake that his things will not be "cleared away".

Later, the research institute updated the equipment and changed to electornika 60, a computer made by the Soviet Union to imitate Dec LSI-11 of the United States, which can only display text instead of graphics. With the "new toy", anyone wants to have a good time. Alexei, who is active and restless, also has such an idea. His idea is even more exaggerated. He wants to make a game with this computer so that he can spend his time after work. Alexei is not the only one who has this idea. Because of his love for programming, Alexei got to know two other programmers: Dimitri Pavlovski and Vadim grahimov. With the participation of others, they decided to let the game not only spend their time after work, but also get it to the market Selling money can not only entertain but also earn extra money. Isn't it nice to kill two birds with one stone?

# more fun than toys
In the 1940s, a kind of educational toy was very popular both at home and abroad. It was called "twelve pieces of puzzle" in China. It was a kind of board game. It was composed of twelve pieces of wood with different shapes, and each piece was composed of five small cubes, so it was also called "five pieces of bone". These twelve pieces of wood can form a variety of patterns. The most popular way to play with them is to try to put them into a rectangular base plate. You will find that you need to use your brain to put all the pieces into the base plate. The design of this game involves five or six kinds of mathematics subjects, such as geometry and topology. It is researched by scholars in various fields at home and abroad, so it is highly praised by mathematicians.

The classic puzzle game "mind boggling twelve pieces"
Alexei liked this puzzle toy very much when he was a child, so he thought of making a game similar to this toy, but the number of texts that can be displayed by computer is limited, and there are only rectangles in text characters, so Alexei reduced the number of rectangles of each graph from five to four, and reduced the number of graphs to seven and grouped them with rectangles Close to a square. The development cycle of the game is not long. It took only six days to complete. But after the game was made, they found a problem: because of the deletion of various contents, the difficulty of the game is extremely simple, basically only need to crack once, there is no suspense, no challenge and playability, so Alexei can only modify the game, and the direction of modification is the game Rules.

Only seven patterns left
Alexei changed the rules of the game to seven different shapes of patterns falling from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen in a limited area in a random order. Players can control the position and direction of these patterns when they fall, and fill the whole area by continuously splicing these patterns. And if it's full, the game is over. Although it's exciting, it can't give the players the motivation to challenge. So Alexei modifies the rules of the game again. When the small squares that make up the pattern can fill a whole line, they will be eliminated and fall a line, so that the players can keep playing until the pattern is stacked to the top of the screen Bundle.
In this way, the thrill and playability of the game are improved. The endless playing methods are a little bit addictive. The final product makes Alexei unable to stop playing. This game doesn't even need a tutorial. Anyone can easily play it. Alexei named this game Tetris, which is a representative number in Greek Word 4 "TetR" is a combination of his favorite sport, "tennis.".

The first Tetris in history
# the real meaning of "popular in the world"
There is also a very wonderful copyright business war around Tetris. For the reason of space, the author will only elaborate here. Interested friends can watch the documentary "the story of Tetris" produced by the famous broadcaster "game historian". What we need to know is that in the same period, "Tetris" is a hot cake among many game manufacturers, because it is very addictive. It seems that whoever can get the copyright of this game can make a lot of money in an instant. The game first became popular in Alexei's Research Institute for a while, then the whole Soviet Union, and spread to other countries through many trade personnel who often go abroad. Finally, Nintendo took the lead in winning the distribution right and sold the game with the same model of game boy. In a short time, it achieved a very terrible sales volume of 35 million sets.

End of       
Since it is so popular, Alexei, who invented the game, must be a rich man now, right? In fact, the game was born in the Scientific Research Institute of the Soviet Union, so the copyright of the game should be owned by the government. After several twists and turns, the Russian government didn't return the copyright of the game to him until eleven years after the game had been on the market. At that time, "Tetris" had already passed his most beautiful time, but Alexei still relied on it The game has made a lot of money and continues to this day.

Tesla modle s of Alexei, with the license plate of Tetris
The invincible story of Tetris is still going on. Now it's the 35th idea of Tetris. Alexei is also a 63 year old uncle, but he still has enough capital and conditions to stand out. Media once asked him, "do you think people will continue to play your game in a hundred years?" Alexei's answer is yes. The reason is that no matter how many years have passed, the nature and nature of human brain will not change greatly. Chess has been played for thousands of years and people are not happy. Happiness is very important for human beings. As long as people can feel happiness from the game, it will not change for many years (Tetris) It will be out of date.
