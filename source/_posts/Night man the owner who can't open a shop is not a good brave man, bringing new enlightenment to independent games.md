Speaking of the game produced in Poland, it is estimated that most people will think of the wizard series for the first time. As a national treasure of Poland, the name of the developer cdpr "Polish donkey" may be more popular than their real name. In fact, although there are not many works of the same quality as "Wizard" in Poland, there are many excellent and well-known works, such as the classic strategy game "this is my war", the perfect combination of Parkour and zombie fighting "vanishing light" and so on, which are all created by Polish game developers.

# open shop in the daytime and explore in the evening
A long time ago, the author wrote a novel about a young sailor who was born as a pirate who was attacked by storms and sea monsters in the process of going back to sea. His ship was destroyed. However, the young sailor was rushed to a new continent which had not been recorded on the map by the storm. Because of his disconnection from the outside world, he could only settle here temporarily A new continent. By chance, he got a note that once belonged to an explorer, in which he recorded the experiences of various legends and legends of various treasures. Then, out of the instinct of pirates, he began to explore the new continent. With more and more treasures, he was helpless in order to hide his identity as a treasure hunter A small town in the new world has opened a grocery store, displaying all the treasures in the store. Whoever buys these treasures will not sell them. So in his spare time or in the quiet of the night, he went out to search for treasures. When people in the small town had many eyes, he stayed in the shop and looked at these treasures. The story revolved around the treasure hunter and every "close friend" who visited the shop.

"Night man" is such a novel with some similarities. The player will play a young boss in the game. He needs to take care of the grocery store which has been passed down for several generations. The commodities on the shelf are all kinds of spoils that the protagonist gets every night when he goes to the dungeon to fight against monsters. In short, the mode atmosphere of the game is divided into two stages. The content of the day-to-day shop is the simulation operation, while the night adventure is the dungeon ARPG with rougelite elements, and the name of "Moonlight" comes from this. In fact, although the design of the combination of management and RPG seems very novel, it has been used in games for a long time. The most representative work is "lucitia: a magic recipe for props house management" produced by Japanese game studio easygamestation in 2007. As a boss and a brave adventurer, he can not only sell money, but also strengthen his own weapons and equipment. Therefore, players with dual identities usually need to think about "money" and "power", which is the core idea of the game.

Lucitia: the best way to manage props house
# first battle won
Although the game "night man" was released by the famous 11bit, it was developed by an unknown game company, and the game was also their first original work. The company's name is digital sun, and now there are about 30 people. In fact, only six people participate in the production of this game. Because digital sun is not only a game development department, but also mainly responsible for outsourcing services before the production of "night man". The main business of the whole company is to produce mobile games and advertising games, and occasionally undertake some game demo framework building Construction work, and "night man" is just one of their company's many plans.
The company has been established for more than six years, and they always insist on doing these works. Anyway, they are also a game development team, and they certainly want to make an original work of their own. For a long time, several core members of the company are often busy and idle, and several people sit together to discuss and do some creative work. In this case, the "night man" is composed of countless people One day, they realized that it might not be difficult to play such a game. Within their capacity, they may have the opportunity to do it seriously.

Game design materials
For a company that undertakes outsourcing work all the year round, since it wants to do original work, the first condition is to have money, and the company's income for many years can only meet the basic normal operation of the company, only a little savings can be used for investment, so a very common operation in the independent game circle appears: the company has opened crowdfunding on KickStarter, with a goal of 4 Ten thousand dollars. The company put some set materials and content on the crowdfunding page to show the type of game to the players, hoping to get the attention of other interested players. However, it didn't realize that the game received a total of $134000 from 5229 supporters in a month, which far exceeded the company's expectation. The game received KickStarter support Hold, has a higher exposure than other products, at the same time, the name of the game is also gradually spread among many players, so that the reputation of the game has been growing.

Game crowdfunding interface
Up to now, this work has more than 4000 reviews on steam, of which the praise rate is about 80%, and the sales volume of this work on the whole platform has exceeded 500000. In short, although the work adopting this unique game mode is not the first one of "night watchman", it is very rare in European and American game circles and even in the whole independent game circles. There are many players who like to fight in dungeons, and there are not a few who like to open a shop slowly. If we combine the two, it can be called "double" happiness, plus the work in the war The Dou part adopts rougelite mechanism, and the picture chooses the pixel wind which is more friendly to the people. There is a feeling of "dreaming back GBA" in the overall appearance, so it is difficult not to spread in this not too big circle.

    concluding remarks  
Digital sun's first battle is over, and it has made great achievements. The appearance of the "night man" also brings new enlightenment to the independent game development field: the development of independent game is a field that requires creativity to achieve success. After all, it has no high investment or high cost, and it can't rely on hard technology like 3A game to add more points, even if it doesn't What's a good idea? If we combine the existing game types organically with a good setting, it can also present a bright effect. Digital sun's success may seem easy, but in fact, it's not just a chance to get lucky. Their outsourcing work has provided them with sufficient experience for many years. Javier Jimenez, CEO of the development team, said: it's never easy to play games. Don't underestimate the difficulty of the game. Even if you are engaged in other work, you should take your career seriously.
