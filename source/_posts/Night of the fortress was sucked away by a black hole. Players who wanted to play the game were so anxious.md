On October 14, 2019, a big event happened in epic's popular escape game "night of the fortress": players stopped fighting one after another, set up high platforms in the game map and looked up at the sky. A rocket rises to the ground and rushes up into the night, blasting the sky with cracks like a dimension wall. Many unidentified meteorites and missiles constantly bombard the game world of "night of the fortress". At last, all the incoming attacks gather in one place, causing a huge explosion and at the same time, a black hole is opened on the ground, and then everything you see is inhaled into it, including the player's corner Color, then the game into the dark, leaving only a blue aperture in the center of the screen.

Players can't start the game, only stare at the black screen stupidly, can't start a new round of game, no matter how to restart, they can only see this picture. "Night of the fortress" was pushed from the official to the shopping mall. All the tweets and pictures were deleted, leaving only the black head and the same blue aperture as the game picture. Players familiar with "night of the fortress" should be aware that this is a regular activity in every season when the version of the game changes. Although players have long expected the official action, they did not expect this time to be so powerful.

#I can't stand it
Players can personally witness the destruction of the game world in the game, which is the first time in the whole game history. In the past Games, they usually add subtle changes to the game slowly, and the specific process is to rely on CG animation to express. Apart from "cool", I can't think of any other way to describe this activity. It's obvious that this time, epic wants to meet the new map replacement of the next season in this way, so it's a good way to attract players' attention and make a very proper reason for the whole day's downtime maintenance. For the game itself, it's undoubtedly a good thing to welcome the big version update. But epic's unexpected coming suddenly makes the players who are playing the game lose their eyes. The players don't know when the event should start and end. It's sad for many players who like this game. As of the time of writing, the live video of the event has been viewed on overseas YouTube websites for nearly 5 million times, and on twitch for nearly 2 million. Although the popularity of the game in China is not high, the upsurge in overseas is obvious to all.

Dark official push
In foreign countries, many children, in a state of ignorance, found that they could not enter the game when they returned home and opened the game machine. They didn't know whether the monitor was broken or the host was broken. Some of them were so angry that they jumped their feet and smashed the TV. Some of them were even more wronged to tears. Apart from children, even adults expressed their dissatisfaction with the event: "who would stare at such a black hole for hours?" Some people even wait until they fall asleep in front of the screen. They run to the official of epic to say that they want epic to play the game quickly, or they will go to the relevant authorities to sue them. In their opinion, after all, they spend money in this game, but they can't play the game without money, which is no different from fraud. However, up to now, there are still tens of thousands of players sticking to the live broadcast room of "black hole", staring at the aperture in the screen and expecting to change a little. No matter what kind of response this marketing campaign caused, at least in the current situation, epic's goal is achieved.

"I came home from school and found you couldn't play fortress night."
# pay and return
As I mentioned above, for players familiar with the game, these contents designed by epic in the game are not new. As early as the S9 season, there was a huge robot standing on the ground on the map of the game. With the slow progress of the whole season and gradual formation, it was not formally completed until the end of the season, At the same time, there are many traces left by giant monsters on the game map throughout the season, and it is not until the countdown to the end of the season officially ends that everything finally begins: the giant monsters rise from the sea, and the robots on the other side immediately attack the monsters. The battle between the two is imminent, and all players can play in the game world Watch the war in real time. This battle is very spectacular and has the feeling of "Pacific Rim". In fact, this battle between robots and monsters really pays homage to "Pacific Rim" and ends with the victory of robots.

The battle between robots and monsters
Not only "night of the fortress", but also many other games have launched such "unidentified and fierce" marketing activities when they were publicized. However, they may not be as wonderful as "night of the fortress". This black hole time reminds many players of the metamorphosis of MMORPG online game "Final Fantasy 14" from version 1.0 to 2.0 in the early years. At first, the quality of the game in version 1.0 was too bad, and it was useless except for the quality of the picture. So se gave the follow-up remedial work of the game to a man named Yoshida Zhishu, even in his opinion The game is almost hopeless. From the inside to the outside, it exudes the smell of "problem children". So Yoshida decided to keep on developing a new game to replace the existing version. For this reason, they have not finished 1.0 yet and designed a very "Final Fantasy" style plan, which is to directly put the 1.0 world into the form of plot performance Destroy it and lead to a new version of the new world.

The red moon in Iowa
Today's "Final Fantasy 14" has been updated to version 5.0, and its overall quality and reputation are constantly improving. Now it may have been the MMORPG game with the highest comprehensive quality on the market. Now, looking back at the original version 1.0, it's just like a disaster in the plot. Although the two have the same pattern, they have totally different interests. Since the official transition of Fortress night to the big escape game, its popularity has remained high overseas. At the end of each season, there will be an extremely gorgeous curtain call performance. This time, it is the same practice, only a little sudden; and the final fantasy 14 is pure It's a decision they have to make to save the game, and it turns out that the choices they make are worth it, so they are approved by the industry and recognized by the players.

Final fantasy 14: the reverse flame of shadow
    concluding remarks  
No matter "night of the fortress" or "Final Fantasy 14", although these marketing models are very eye-catching, they are more sincere than the general advertising and announcement. If they don't have a passion for their products, maybe no one is willing to use this time-consuming and laborious way. And "Final Fantasy 14" has become the best MMORPG in the industry, and "night of the fortress" has become the most successful work ever by epic, which fully proves this point. They are really doing games with their hearts, and the players have fun, and their money is also solid. There may be many more such works on the market, but thousands of words come together into one sentence: A good plan for a game is really very important.
