In April this year, Japan's Toyo Co., Ltd. released the first trailer of CG animated film "the brave fights the Dragon: your story". This film is authorized and produced by Japanese game manufacturer square Enix (Se for short). It is based on the plot of the most popular fifth generation game work "bride of the sky" and released in Japan on August 2, 2019 ã€‚ When the classic and familiar theme song is played in the trailer, the author is very excited. After all, it's the same product of se. There are several films in the final fantasy series, but none in the brave fight against the Dragon (DQ). Se is known as the "movie factory". There's no doubt about its strength in making films, but whether it can tell a good story or not Things are waiting to be seen.

It is expected that this theatre version is of high quality in both production and dubbing, and the plot performance is also excellent. However, the ending of the film has stabbed many fans in the heart of the series. Therefore, the movie's public praise has been polarized and controversial, saying "this is a smear for the brave fight against the dragon". After a while, the fans' anger subsided, and they focused on another work of this IP, so that the image of "the brave fight against the dragon" of this IP was righted again.

# two major IPS
As we all know, se has the two most valuable RPG game IPS in Japan, one is the "ultimate fantasy" series known as "the most influential RPG in the world", and the other is the "brave fight against the dragon" series known as "Japanese national RPG". By comparing these two titles, we can see that one of these two IPS is for the local market of Japan, and the other is for the local market of Japan Overseas global market. In the early years, square and Enix held one IP respectively. Although they were in the same company after the merger, they never intersected and interfered with each other. Although they were both Japanese RPGs, it was difficult to form any relationship between them due to different themes and styles. In order to make the brand accepted by people all over the world, the final fantasy series has always adopted a kind of artistic style similar to the combination of Japanese style and European and American style. The appearance and modeling of the characters are more inclined to the Japanese style of beautiful painting, while the construction of the scene and the design of the background are more inclined to the European and American style, combining the most distinctive parts between the two sides, forming a kind of artistic style in Europe and America The most eye-catching art style recognized by the game industry.

DQ, on the other hand, is quite conservative in comparison. It focuses on the local market of Japan, and a routine can stick out to 11 and always maintain high quality. Although the "brave and the devil" story is conventional in the current perspective, it is as simple and direct as a fairy tale, deeply rooted in the people's heart, and its influence is not easily shaken by other works. For example, although the famous novel Wukong biography reshapes the story of journey to the West in a dark style, and it is a good work in the plot and literature research, but it can never reach the height of the original, and it is still the original version of journey to the West more influential. Back to DQ, the story setting of the game has always been a fantasy adventure in the different world since the early generation, and the main creator, soundtrack and painter of the game have never changed. Bird Shanming relies on a dragon ball, which is well known in the Japanese, so no one can not fail to recognize his style of painting. The reason why DQ series has always insisted on using the original people and horses for many years is to prevent Japan from using it The local people are unfamiliar with this series, no matter how they look at it, it is always original and very cordial.

The development of "Final Fantasy" series always pays attention to "high-end", and the primary goal is to pay attention to the extreme in the picture. The latest series of "Final Fantasy 15" uses the "night light engine" which has been polished for many years. It can even show the effect of CG in the picture expression, and there is no "greasy light and shadow" or "messy scene" in other mainstream engines It's a refreshing and comfortable feeling. With the improvement of development technology, the game is also constantly innovated. Since the beginning of expectation, there have been several changes around the fight, such as changing to read bar turn system, real-time turn system, command action system and pure action system. The purpose of these changes is to try to keep the old IP with many years of history keep up with the trend of the times, and always have a feeling of "showing muscles", but in the view of players, these are not the key points of this series. As a Japanese RPG, the most King Story can't be left behind, although the "Final Fantasy" series has not let people down Yes, but it seems that the wind review of "Final Fantasy" in recent years is not good, largely related to the wave after wave of "coquettish operation" of se.

One by one, "I don't know if there's any high-definition version" of "Final Fantasy" has been linked with krypton gold mobile games. The original version of MMORPG game "Final Fantasy 14" was once called "garbage" (although it's turned over now). The latest work "Final Fantasy 15" is still a semi-finished product that hasn't finished the story even two years after its release. It's simple In SE's opinion, the name of "Final Fantasy" is inlaid with Phnom Penh. As long as new works are produced, no matter what they are made of, they will be bought and played by others. In recent years, scandals about them have made them aware of their problems. They decided to slow down the improvement of the series of hard technologies and focus on the most fundamental games Design and story telling can be seen from the highest score of MMORPG ever obtained by final fantasy 14 and the traditional retro pixel turn setting adopted by novice players. As for final fantasy 15, it may not be saved.

As mentioned above, although DQ series has chosen a conservative route, it is also trying to innovate. However, the traditional RPG mode of its orthodox works is absolutely unchanged. This is because they have tried to change the orthodox works into action games, but the players are very dissatisfied with this. A large number of players say that if DQ is changed into action games, then it must be Will not buy, but can only change back. They don't want to change, but they dare not. The good reputation and stable quality accumulated over the years are the basis for this series to continue to sell well, so they can only make articles on other derivative works, such as the cooperation with Koei to launch the "mowing" game "DQ: Yingxiong" series, the "DQ: Chuangshi little player" series, which combines RPG and sandbox, and so on All of them are trying to expand this IP to other fields, and it seems that the title of "national RPG" is the guarantee of quality. These works are not performing well in the early stage, and if we launch a sequel, we can get back the reputation, which is undoubtedly a virtue.

The latest work of "DQ" mentioned at the beginning of the article is another new attempt of this IP in a new field: "DQ: walk" is an AR themed mobile game, just like "baokemeng go" in the early years. DQ walk is to let players play a brave man with their mobile phones to explore and fight around Japan. In the game, players are provided with an RPG that can be created by themselves In the world, every plot has its own settings, which can be said to be a perfect combination of traditional RPG and AR outdoor exploration. Soon after the game went online, it ranked first in various markets. The reputation of the players was very popular, which reversed the reputation of the movie. Before that, "DQ" also had a variety of mobile tours abroad, but its performance can only be described by ordinary, and this time it is undoubtedly to make people's impression of "DQ" mobile tour changed.

    concluding remarks  
It's ironic that the final fantasy series was isolated from the very beginning, thinking that they were fearless, only to realize their problems after a few times of eating, and decided to lay a good foundation again from scratch, from "high-end" to "conservative", which undoubtedly felt backward; while the DQ series was consistent for many years On the basis of the bold attempt to derivative works, even AR, a novelty, is quite interested, and has achieved success. Undoubtedly, it is a little step forward, forming a situation of position exchange with "Final Fantasy", which seems slightly ridiculous. But in any case, this is a good thing for both of them. Neither of them is a work that can seal the gods. Although they are not young, they still have a way to go. I hope that after this "slow down of rhythm", both of them can bring more high-quality works to the players.
