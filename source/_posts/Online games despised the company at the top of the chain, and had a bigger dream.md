At the end of May, Netease released the mobile game live screen of Eve Star Wars Eve: the river of stars without ashes at the Interactive Entertainment Conference, which aroused the discussion among players and expressed the experience of operation like Eve and its tedious mobile game.
Since the agent work of Eve ol in China was transferred from century Tiancheng to Netease, there has been no big move. This time, we transplanted this heavyweight IP to mobile platform. Although in the eyes of our players, it may have ruined this IP, polluted the game environment and so on, on the good side, logging in to the mobile terminal will undoubtedly increase the exposure rate of the game, otherwise, we only rely on it It's really hard for the existing players to keep the game running.

When it comes to Eve, many players seem to recognize it as the existence of "you can't play without a doctor's degree", "you have to make formulas to start a shot", "online games despise the top of the chain". He is a synonym for the space sandbox game, but due to the too complex content and its poor operation, ordinary players can turn off the game in four or five minutes with a dull face, and those who can stick to it are hard core players who really like hard science fiction and study hard.

However, not everyone is willing to be a hard core player. Although Eve has been running for so many years, it can still maintain a stable number of players from a commercial point of view, which is not a small success, but even the most fun games have a life cycle. Eve, a player with a small number of players, is no exception. Therefore, how can we continue to make our own king Brand IP long-term vitality is also the biggest issue developers should consider.
# CCP's "wild hope"
The universe is always a very mysterious topic for people. It is just because the mystery of the universe can arouse people's infinite imagination, and the relevant creators can also give full play to their genius ideas, so we are lucky to have access to a variety of cross domain and diversified related subject products.
Speaking of making the most famous sci-fi game in the field of video games, Chris Roberts, known as the "godfather of space games", has developed "interstellar citizen". "Star citizen" has a well-designed space colonial planet and space station for players to explore, and there are very deep spacecraft operation and space tangle, players can also go out of the spacecraft to control your pilot's random action, use guns to fight with other enemies, although the game has not been fully developed so far, but with the existing content is enough to achieve many Player's space dream.

Why is interstellar citizen mentioned here? Because no matter in who's eyes, this kind of game is the ultimate form of space game, which is the most desired space game for players. Although the content of Eve is rich enough, it is only a space star wars game after all, and does not contain a combat system that can make people feel refreshed. For this reason, the Icelandic CCP, the developer of the game, has such a grand plan:   they want to make an FPS game, a VR air war simulation game, and these games can be linked and synchronized with Eve to achieve three A comprehensive war in which different dimensions can influence each other.  
Imagine "Eve" players controlling the fleet in the air, Gunners controlling the turrets on the warship to shoot out dense light and shells, small ships swimming through the warships, the explosion debris fell on the ground near the two soldiers in short combat, can participate in such a huge science fiction battlefield in person enough to make many science fiction fans salivate.

#  "Trinity?"  
Since we have to do so, the first project launched by CCP is FPS game, named Eve: dust 514, which is a shooting game integrating FPS, RTs and RPG, and the time of occurrence in Eve will directly affect dust 514. These settings sound very attractive, and the CCP did what they boasted at the beginning, but who can guarantee the quality of such an avant-garde game? The game landed on the PS3 platform at the end of last era and was released in the form of free.

Why do not manufacturers dare to play such a game except CCP? Because the design is too avant-garde, there are problems in all aspects of the design of the game: the picture of the game is not excellent, but mediocre; the hand feel of weapons and driving is very bad, obviously lack of experience in the development of relevant content; since the game is released free, it means that krypton gold is needed inside the game, but it can be accepted if the price is reasonable, but krypton gold is not good Fun that's a fatal problem.
The immaturity of the game system and the distracted charging mechanism make the game perform badly in the experience of playing. Many media have given failing scores, and the update speed is slow in the later stage of the game, resulting in the suspension of service within less than four years of operation.

The first attempt ended with the death of "dust 514", but the CCP did not feel depressed about it, but turned its attention to the next project. Even before VR devices began to be popularized on the market, CCP announced its next game, Eve: Valkyrie, which will be a VR air war simulation game, in which players can fly small space fighters to participate in the grand space war experience real air dog fight.

CCP has come to the front of the industry again this time. They have expected that the next period of time will be the explosive growth stage of VR technology, and even lead the new wave of entertainment technology. With more and more manufacturers releasing information about VR equipment, many capitalists have also taken a fancy to this fertile land to be developed, and CCP has also got a fund sponsorship for the development of "Valkyrie". Now that there is money, we have to polish the game. 2016 is called the first year of VR. There is a tripartite confrontation in the market, led by oculus, PSVR and HTC vive. At this time, our "Valkyrie" is still being polished, and it will not be released until the second half of 2017.

The game only landed on the PC platform. As one of the first batch of VR games published, the image quality of Valkyrie is undoubtedly the best. Compared with the consistent rough works on the market, Valkyrie is undoubtedly the best work that meets the requirements of the players.
Of course, to experience the most powerful VR game is bound to pay a little price. As a PC-side VR game, its price has reached a staggering 400 RMB, and with all DLC content, it can reach a sky high price of nearly 2000 RMB. The price of its own VR device is already high, and it also needs a computer with excellent configuration, and it also costs 2000 yuan to buy a game, who is it to change I don't think so. As a result, although the quality of the game is excellent, but the sales volume is very low, CCP has to reduce the price of the game, but who can think that the popularity of VR soon passed away.

    concluding remarks  
Since then, CCP has also launched some simple VR games for mobile phones, but the popularity of VR has gone, and it can no longer attract the attention of players. It's good to have great ambition, but it's too long-term and too big for CCP to stand firm. It's understandable that CCP wants to maintain Eve's popularity. But we can be sure that CCP hasn't been satisfied with the game's interest. What they have been doing is a hard core game for a small number of people, so they can't blame others for the small number of players.
The author has always been interested in the game Eve, but has no chance to contact it due to work reasons. This login to the mobile platform is undoubtedly a timid attempt. I hope that the mobile version can make corresponding adjustments to the mobile platform, otherwise it will not avoid the cold fate.
