In the late 1980s, Nintendo reopened the game market impacted by yadali with its own FC game console, giving people a new understanding of video games. Although Nintendo's game consoles have a great impact on overseas players, and the relationship with us is not very big, but there are also some people who have been lucky to have access to this popular element from overseas since that time, and have a concept of video games for the first time. And Nintendo's rising sun naturally makes many other companies see business opportunities from it, and also want to take a share of profits from it. Among them, the only one who has this ability is Sega, who is rising sun in the field of arcade.

During the period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, Sega seized nearly half of the game market from Nintendo by relying on MD console. There was a situation in which Nintendo dominated the eastern hemisphere market and Sega dominated the Western Hemisphere market for a while. However, such a company has no mainframe industry and no longer wants to compete with other manufacturers. It focuses on the development and distribution of software and becomes extremely humble and low-key. Some people say that the mainframe industry has brought down Sega, while others say that the high cost and low income of game "Shamu" make Sega unable to make ends meet. In fact, these persuasions are not complete What I have to say may be because I am short-sighted and a little unlucky.

During the period when MD hosts occupied half of the country, the game industry was not peaceful. Several game companies seemed to be competing in any kind of arms race, generally competing with each other in science and technology, and all kinds of novel products emerged in an endless stream. Home games ushered in an explosive growth period, so the key is to improve the performance of the host and the performance of the game screen as soon as possible. Sega successively launched two peripherals for MD host, one named Mega CD, and the other named Sega 32x. These two peripherals can be installed on MD host to improve performance. The former can be regarded as an additional CD-ROM drive processing unit, while the latter is an additional new processor module. Although these two peripherals can improve the function of MD, they have a high price. Such a set of prices is no less than buying a new machine, and the new carrier games for these two peripherals are not very attractive, so the achievements of these two peripherals can be said to be quite bleak.

Three in one Sega MD
Strictly speaking, all the money MD has made in the western hemisphere has been wasted on these useless and expensive peripherals, which makes Sega lose his life. Nintendo doesn't have the brainless output of Sega. They think that money should be used on the edge of the blade, rather than the gimmicks. The performance of the game machine is the second, and the key is that the game itself is not fun. Nintendo's new generation of game machine SFC soon had the momentum to catch up with Sega, and Sega also decided to fight hard, only in 32x after-sales soon launched a new generation of host Sega Saturn (also known as SS). Sega Saturn has the ability to hang SFC, and the quality of the game is very excellent. For example, the fighting game "VR warrior" and the racing game "sleepwalking America" which are very popular on the arcade have transplanted versions on the Saturn mainframe. Although the picture is slightly inferior to the arcade, they also have the game experience no less than the mainframe.

Sega Saturn host
# “299”
When Sega Saturn is stabilizing its own market, Sony has inadvertently joined in the battle. In the early years, the partnership with Nintendo broke down, so Sony immediately decided to launch PS console. Although it was unable to compete with Sega due to the lack of game lineup, with the spread of the reputation of PS console, the price and performance performance are better than Sega, and the game lineup is competing Gradually enriched, Sony began to work hard to catch up, and soon surpassed Sega. In fact, the hardware performance of PS host is not much better than that of Saturn, but Saturn's one-dimensional stacking performance leads to the complexity of the host's architecture, and the difficulty of game development will increase along with the branch line, resulting in the failure of Saturn's game works to give full play to the full performance of the host. By contrast, most of the first-party games on PS side are all in-depth development of PS hosts, so it seems only a matter of time before Saturn is overtaken by PS.

However, these things are still in the period when PS and Saturn have not entered the European and American market. As the largest host player group in the world, the weight of the European and American market should not be underestimated. Nintendo has not yet launched a new host plan, that is to say, whoever can get the fat meat first will win this round. At the first E3 game show in 1995, Sega announced that the North American version of Saturn's mainframe was priced at $399, while the Sony PS on the other side was $299, which was a full difference of $100. At that time, you all knew that more than $100 was significant. It was obvious that Sony had lost nothing. After a while, Nintendo also rushed to catch up. Although it came a little later, it brought N64 host and many well received game works to keep up with the trend of the new era, such as legend of Zelda: the flute of time, Nintendo star chaos and other masterpieces were born in this period, leaving only Shijia on the other side to be angry.

Legend of Zelda: flute of time
# Dreamcast
The failure of Saturn made Sega lose a lot of economy, and after continuous eating and shrinking, Sega realized that it should not have the enthusiasm of others. It is necessary to consider the positioning of the host from many aspects, and take a long-term view. But their hosts have always been based on high performance as the selling point, so simply do it thoroughly this time, and directly adopt a better open source The framework makes the development of the game not so difficult as before, and uses new hardware technology to make the host screen rise to the level of another generation, and the host code named "goblin Dao" is called Dreamcast. The game lineup on the DC host can be described as "luxury". The first party of their own arcade masterpieces are all logged in, and they have the image quality of the arcade without losing. There is also the open world action game "Shamu", which is personally operated by Suzuki Yu, the arcade God. With these bonuses, how can we see that DC won't get too bad results.

Sega Dreamcast
In fact, few people will say that the DC host is not good, let alone the game of DC. But in front of Sony's PS2, there is no big reason for anyone to choose DC. In fact, players have high expectations for DC, but due to various reasons, the output of the host is insufficient, resulting in a situation of short supply. The game is excellent, but it is useless to sell the machine. And Sony just took advantage of the low DC shipments. PS2 is not only several times better than DC in performance, but also has a number of kingly IP products launched. Combined with Sony's high popularity before, players think DC may be just another transitional product of Sega, and it will come out new soon. Unexpectedly, under the aggressive attitude of PS2, DC has begun to appear weak. If it is not in Europe and the United States that it often advertises, it will not be sustainable.

Death or life 2, one of DC's signature fighting games
End of       
DC's performance is not ideal again, which once led Sega to the brink of collapse. Finally, in order to maintain the company's livelihood, Sega decided to reduce its staff and scale, and no longer participate in the competition in the host market, but focus on software development, and become a pure game development company other than the arcade. Nintendo, a former rival, has also become the first choice for Sega to join after leaving the host competition. It has successively moved many of her works to Ren's game consoles, which is somewhat funny to outsiders, but it is also what Sega has to do to make a living.

Now, Sega's house watching work like a dragon
Today's Sega is not much more active than before, relying on the series like dragon, all-out war and football manager to obtain stable benefits. Maybe for Sega, she has seen through the fight in this industry. She has suffered deeply until how cruel this industry is. They don't have any extravagant demands anymore. They just hope that the company can continue to operate steadily. After all, if the company is gone, what's the ideal and success?
