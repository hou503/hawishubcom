I have a friend who has a headache recently: the connection between his game handle and the computer market will report an error disconnection, which leads to his inability to play the game well, so he has the idea of buying another game on the host, at least the host will not have the situation of the disconnection of the handle. I'm curious about this. What game must be played with a handle and has such a big attraction? This friend told me: "it's not a masterpiece, it's just an independent game, the price is not expensive, it's called" dead cell "

This is not the first time I heard the name, but it is the first time I heard the game can make people stunned. After a period of contact and understanding, the author found that not only the dead cell itself is very interesting, but also the developers behind it have a very interesting story.
#"Paris Commune" in the game world
Dead cells is a 2D horizontal version of the galaxy like monster city rougelite game developed by motion twin, an independent French game developer. Since the launch of steam in May 2017, it has started the preemptive experience stage. Although it sounds like an unknown game developer, motion twin is actually more qualified than most game companies. Founded in 2001, the company is located in Bordeaux, France, one of the world's top ten famous wine towns, with a history of 18 years. Over the years, the company has never made an end game. In the first 16 years, it almost only made web games. Although the income is not very high, it is enough to feed the company's employees. However, with the passage of time, page games have seen a sharp decline in the global market. Mobile games have robbed a large number of users, but in order to make profits, the company has to change.

The home page of motion twin's official website is their work concept
The working style of the company is quite special. This is a company without a boss. 11 people share the company and the management power of the company. No matter you are a new employee or an old employee, everyone has the same salary, position and voice power. In the past 20 years, this business model has always been the same. The money earned is shared by all. Any decision or even layoff of the company needs to be discussed by all. It's just like the anarchist Paris Commune in the 19th century. Then someone may ask: since everyone makes the same money, how to distinguish between doing more and doing less? In the view of motion twin, they are a team. Naturally, developing games is not just a matter of one person. It is with such a mindset that almost all employees will not be slack.

Motion twin's game works
A senior designer of the company once said that: the adoption of such a system by the company is undoubtedly a challenge to the game development industry, but also a challenge to exploitation and old corporate structure. However, they have to transform their business due to the recession of their business. Since the mobile game platform has robbed our users of the past, we will use the mobile game again. Motion twin's behavior is undoubtedly to want to take a share in this emerging market. However, they are not a full-time mobile game company. Although they have produced many works, they can't earn as much as page games. The company's performance has always been in a declining state. As expected, employees have reached an agreement on the situation of the company: if we are going to close down, we must do something we want to do before we close down. Besides, although our income is not high, it is still stable. Why not try to make a different attempt with this money?

Most of the games are well made, but their playing methods are rather weird
#Tower defense becomes "Galaxy demon city"
According to company officials, "dead cell" was originally a tower defense game called "hordes zreo", including two kinds of playing methods: construction management and platform action. Steve phelby, the company's director and marketing manager, went to steam to "explore the enemy" when everyone else was working on the game development, and studied their competitors and the best of the same kind of works, hoping to find out something beneficial to their own game development. He left the company for a week, but when he returned to the company again, he found that the development team had cut off all the tower defense elements and replaced them with a horizontal action game like galactic demon city, which surprised Steve for a while. Besides surprise, he was also surprised: "are you sure you are not doing me?"

"Dead cell" game screen
According to the staff in charge of the company's development work, they really want to make a tower defense game, but they don't know why they have made a tower defense game that is not fun. The final product after the concept is finalized is far from what they think. This tower defense game is almost the same as a kind of strategic management mobile game on the market. It's just different from other games on the market in terms of art style. Besides this position, this game has no more attractive highlights. But the most terrible thing is that the employees of the company didn't realize this at the beginning. When a friend came to visit the company, they gave some very realistic suggestions in the face of the game, which woke them up. The friend said that the prototype design of the game seems to be added to the game later, but it looks more interesting than tower defense. Why don't you play around this prototype?

Various and refreshing fighting methods
The so-called dreamers realized that this is a very suitable theme for being a single person rather than a multi person, so they began to constantly delete the content, remove all the things related to "Tower Defense" and "multi person", and decided to change the game into a pure horizontal action game. As for the playing method, they hope to adopt the most popular "category" After all, this type is very mature, but how to use this mode of game in the market is not much. Steve, the marketing manager, did nothing this week, but he had to re evaluate the positioning of the game. By studying the predecessors who have been successful in this unique type to determine the core content and key areas, we finally come to the following answer:   the key points of galactic demon city games are fighting, moving, and props balance.

The enemy is full of details
# end
In the end, the product they came up with is the "dead cell" we see today. In terms of playing methods, there are not only the styles of "demon city" and "Galaxy warrior", but also the depth and difficulty similar to the "soul" series. The fighting and hitting sense of the game is very tension, weapons and props cooperate in a variety of ways, and the moving way of the characters is also aimed at the operation habits of the players A special compensation design has been made; the characters use the permanent death mechanism, and the game map design uses rougelite to generate randomly. Every resurrection will have a new game experience. Although the game has adopted a very excellent but long lost game mode, it is not difficult to see that this pattern is still very popular. At the beginning, the game was launched in the EA stage with the idea of testing the water. As a result, it sold 750 thousand copies in a week. The studio initially predicted that if the twenty thousand sets sold in the first three months could keep the studio alive, it would be possible for the studio to survive. Opportunity to develop new games. At first, they expressed their confidence in selling 12000 sets a month. As a result, they achieved this goal in just one day. They not only made money back, but also made a lot of money.

Steam's general comments are highly praised
Up to now, "dead cell" has launched various host versions one after another, and will also launch mobile versions in the future. The sales volume of the game broke through the million level early and is still rising, and has almost won one-sided praise. In view of the great success of "dead cell", motion twin, the developer, did not plan to launch a sequel or expand its team. After all, they still want to keep the "little Paris Commune" because it is impossible to expand its scale. As for the new work, the company said that even if it had "dead cell 2", it would be quite different from this one Type of game.
