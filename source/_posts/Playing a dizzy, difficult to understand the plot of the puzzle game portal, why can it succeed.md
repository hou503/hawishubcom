I usually like to try all kinds of puzzle games with different styles, no matter it's text, action or terror. I seldom download popular competitive games or leisure games on my mobile phone. I often install some puzzle games with burning brain most of the time, as "reading before sleep" for a while before I go to bed.
Puzzle games are just like cooking. You can fry eggs and then fry potatoes. They are actually all kinds of games. For example, when you see an iron box screwed by a screw, you will think of finding a screwdriver. When you see a strange arrangement, you will think of whether it will be a password. If you often play puzzle games, you will be able to solve most puzzle games The way to solve the mystery is as clear as your fingers.

The brain hole of the puzzle game is only produced by rust Lake
The portal series that we are going to talk about this time is a very unique existence in the puzzle game. It is a puzzle game that goes beyond the normal routine, but it must be combined with common sense to solve puzzles. It is very easy to understand. It uses its own unique system and style to show the puzzle shape that can only be realized in the portal Type. It's hard for you to describe the excellence of this game with others. Even if you can explain it clearly, it's hard to attract other players successfully.

One day in 2005, Robin Walker was invited to participate in the career development day organized by dijibon Institute of technology in the United States. This is an annual activity held by dijibon Institute of technology, inviting professionals from all walks of life to teach experience to students. For students, this is undoubtedly the best time to find a job.
Walker is a game producer. After the experience sharing session, he chose to visit the students' works. At that time, a small group of people stopped Walker and showed his works to Walker: this small group called themselves "nuclear monkey software", and their works to Walker were called "narbacular drop". The play method of the game is to control a princess trapped in the dungeon, use two conveyor doors that can be pasted on any plane, enter from this door and come out from another door, players need to use this prop to escape from the dungeon.

3D independent games were not common in those days
This play method is very novel, but it's only a relatively novel play method. The process is very short, there are only six puzzles, and even the saving function is not available. For walker, it's not enough to attract other people's attention, so he just left a name card for the "nuclear monkeys" and left in a hurry.
A year after that, the game won the student display award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival. Just as the members of "nuclear monkey" were immersed in the joy of winning the award, the man named Walker found them again and asked, "would you like to come to valve? We can talk. It turns out that Robin walker is the producer of the "army fortress" series. The concept of "Narcissus drop" attracted the V club, and hired all the members of "nuclear monkey" to the headquarters of V club. With the help of V club, they developed the game called "portal" with the concept of "Narcissus drop".

Members of "nuclear monkey", even if they go to V club, never more than 10 people

The core of the game is to escape from the dungeon, while to the portal, the core of the game is to escape from the laboratory; in the portal, only one enemy is the devil, and in the portal, only one enemy is called glados. In this way, we can see how similar the two concepts are. At first, the portal didn't get the right to sell alone, but was bundled into the promotion game "the orange box" of V club, which was presented free of charge in the form of small games. However, the portal, with its own high quality, defeated numerous 3A masterpieces, and won more than 30 game awards, becoming the most in 2007 after "half life 2: Chapter 2" Big black horse.

"One box, five games"
Careful players may find that there is almost no HUD in the portal except for the standard star. Its very clean UI and the color matching of "blue, white and orange" give people a very refreshing feeling. Players who have played the first person Parkour game "the edge of the mirror" should be able to feel the same feeling. The overall art style is very unified, and the clean picture and the sense of Technology The combination of scenes is enough to be one of the key words of the portal.
The collocation of the main colors will directly affect the players' accurate memory of a game. It can become a representative element of the game, not only the content but also the color. For example, when we talk about blue and yellow, we can think of the radiation series. Red and white are easy to think of the assassin's creed, while blue, white and orange are easy to think of the portal.

The overall style of the game is very simple, there is no other redundant content
In fact, the plot of the game is very obscure and unclear. Therefore, although there are only three characters in the two works of the series, the protagonist, the terminal glados and the chatterbox Whitley, most of the time, the dialogue in the game will let the players understand or not.
The game cleverly uses the environment narration, adds the deliberately designed words or patterns in each corner of the game, and combines the very representative scenes and artistic styles in the above, even in addition to solving puzzles, it will make the players interested in the world beyond the puzzles, and generate the desire to explore. The plot of the game is difficult to understand at first, but when you finish the game once and know the process and strategy of the game, and then look back at the plot of the game again, you will find a surrealism story full of all kinds of bad tastes.

The first generation of glados was bombed and the second generation was awakened by the protagonist. I don't know how the players feel
These are all the contents beyond the riddle solving. Since the key of the riddle solving game is naturally still on the riddle solving body, the game is carried out from the perspective of the first person, and gives the player a gun that can "open the door" on the plane. This gun has no killing power, only two functions of lifting heavy objects and opening the door.
A transport gun, a closed space, so in fact, the whole game is like one after another "secret room escape", but with the help of the super group physical effect of the "sourcs" engine and the unique use of the transport gun, the whole secret room escape becomes more "three-dimensional", which is different from the previous use of props to find the way and then open the exit, but most of the time Props and exits are all in front of you. How to reach the past is the key to the puzzle. In nature, it has changed from "finding props" to "finding the way", covering a wider range. Therefore, the plasticity of the game has also become stronger, and sometimes there is not only one way to pass.

The two generation of gel was also designed by students from DigiPen Institute of Technology, and then joined the V society.
    concluding remarks  
The portal series has never been widely publicized, and there is almost no strong commercial atmosphere in it. In other words, it is not a game developed to make money, but more to express the brand-new thinking of V club on the game industry: it has proved to the world that good ideas are enough to defeat high-cost 3A masterpieces, and good plots do not have to pass Dialogue driven, a good puzzle game is not only one way of design.
Many distinctive elements have made the portal series a success, which gives the game industry a new way of thinking. It's not hard for us to find that there is never a lack of revolutionary elements and ideas in the game developed by V society. Nowadays, the development level of the game industry is almost the same average standard, and the ideas for the game are also different. Maybe in the process of exploring new ideas, V Society has lost its direction and inspiration, otherwise, why G can't count three?
