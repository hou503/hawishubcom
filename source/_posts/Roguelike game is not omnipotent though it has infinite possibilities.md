I don't know when many independent games or mobile games begin to define themselves as "rogue like games". For the players who first come into contact with this new word, they may not understand what it means, but for those who come into contact with it, they may be able to understand how much rogue like is. When we usually play games, we are eager for a work we like. Its content should be rich enough, its playability should be strong enough, and the whole process should keep a fresh game experience, so as to maximize the life of the game.

It's not just the players who think that, but the game manufacturers who don't want to rely on a game can eat for several years. Through the market survey, it is found that players are very interested in the game full of randomness, and there was such a game full of randomness a long time ago. Although it is small, it is just in line with the appetite of players. It is not only time-saving and labor-saving to make such a game without worrying about the problem that the content is not rich enough. Isn't it nice to kill two birds with one stone? In fact, even if it is random, the market is full of all kinds of rogue like games, which have begun to make the players feel aesthetic fatigue.
# “XXLike？”  
In today's game field, especially in the stand-alone field, we see the titles of game types such as "soul like", "Galaxy demon city like". These "xxlike" are "like XX game" as its name implies, while "like rogue" is "like rogue" as its name implies.
Rogue is an adventure game developed by Mike toyes and Gran wichman on UNIX system in 1980. It's a luxury for a computer game in 1980s to have an image. The game image of rogue is very simple, but it's surrounded by various characters into a variety of inexplicable graphics. Players control a symbol "@" and surround it with characters The target is the deepest talisman in the dungeon.

"Chen" is the channel and "+" is the entrance and exit. All the pictures of adventure depend on your imagination
It seems that this game is similar to other adventure games at that time, but the two producers are a little lazy. They don't want to spend a lot of time and energy on the level design of the game, so they think of using code to first make up various different scenes, and then using code to make them randomly according to certain rules. Every time the player dies, the world will be made Disappear, and then regenerate into a new game world.
The design of the first two is just for their own convenience, but inadvertently they invented a game mode. Every time a player dies, the game regenerates a new world, which means that every time the game is played, it has a different experience. In the most exaggerated form, it greatly enhances the life of the game, and the freshness covers the frustration derived from failure The more you play, the more addictive you become.

The success of rogue has also inspired many other manufacturers. Like rogue, games that use randomly generated worlds are also called "rogue like games" by players. Although the playability of this game mode is very strong, but from another point of view, the death penalty of rogue like is also very severe. The death of rogue is irreversible. If you play in an archive for a long time, you will see the end, but there is a strange thing you can't beat. Once you die, it means that all you have done before will be wasted.
In this regard, some manufacturers choose to adjust this mechanism, such as adding the function of archiving, while others choose to keep this setting, aiming at the difficulty of keeping the game for hard core players. So, although roguelike game has a high playability, it is also a kind of hard core game, and not everyone can accept it.

Roguelike's masterpiece "dwarf fortress" is the victim of this "definition"
#Different ways do not conspire
As mentioned above, because of the hard core of the game style, there are not many people who know but are willing to try, which makes the game type in a small crowd state.
Before that, the definition of roguelike game by the players' group was: a roguelike game must have the same elements as rogue, and even the characters and pictures used due to insufficient functions are also the elements that roguelike game must have, otherwise it cannot be called roguelike. This makes the subsequent roguelike game subject to considerable constraints. If you want to upgrade the screen, you can't upgrade it. These so-called "hard core players" are really pretentious.

Roguelike nethack with network online function
In 2008, the fans and developers of roguelike game held a meeting in Germany. In this meeting, they discussed the standard definition of roguelike game again: randomly generated world at the beginning of each game; death can't be revived; players and NPC take turns to act (turn system); map layout is grid like; fight doesn't need to enter the special battle interface; freedom can't be too low, angle The color attribute is customized by the player; the monster does not need to be set except for the basic value; the game world needs to explore by itself, and the backplane is useless here.
This definition has aroused the dissatisfaction of many developers. No one has the qualification for what they say. Integrity is the golden age of independent games. More and more high-quality independent games begin to appear on the market. These former roguelike developers decided to join the independent game camp and develop a new one Type of game.

Sandbox masterpiece my world is inspired by dwarf fortress
#"Lite" following the trend
When the randomness of roguelike is combined with other game types, infinite possibilities are derived. According to the verifiable data, the first non roguelike game that uses the mechanism similar to roguelike is spelunky, an independent game launched in 2009. This is a 2D board game. The map of the game, like roguelike, uses death to regenerate randomly There will never be the same level.
There are not many Roguelike elements in cave exploration, so they call this game mode "RogueLite", which is the common type in the market. In the eyes of those traditional roguelike players, the game may be pediatrics and non entry, but in fact, once launched, it has attracted the attention of many players. It seems that the freshness generated by this level at random has not appeared in the market for a long time. The last well-known game was Diablo 2 nine years ago.

The painting style of cave exploration is very fresh
The success of "cave exploration" has set off a lot of waves in the independent game circle. Other independent game producers have found various possibilities, and many high-quality roguelite games have appeared in the market successively, among which many works have been tried by the author himself. As a result, an unexpected situation has emerged, that is, following the trend. For a while, almost all independent game studios were developing roguelite games, and there were all kinds of mixed works, which made the players feel aesthetic fatigue for roguelite for a short time.
Jonathan Broll, an independent game producer I like very much, once said, "when you peel off the shell of a game and only examine the core playing methods of the game, it's clear whether the game is worth playing or not." Obviously, many independent games under the flag of roguelike on the market can't not only afford such inspection, but also can't even type their names correctly.

Raguelite independent game "the union of Isaac"
These games did not inherit the soul of their predecessors, but simply put a bunch of messy mechanisms into the randomly generated map, and then set up harsh death penalty, which seems to be a "hard core game" that needs to be studied hard. The actual content of the upstream play is very thin, and the playability has no achievements.
Some people may say that it's not easy for them to make a game because of the lack of manpower in the studio, but that doesn't mean that they can play such a sentiment card to launch a substandard work. The famous independent game "please show me the documents", "the return of Oberlin" is even developed by one person; the popular independent game "super carnivorous boy" has a super long game Process and very sophisticated level design are only two cooperative development. Independent game making is not an excuse for rough game making.

It's hard to imagine that "the return of Oberlin" is a game with a huge plot, and it comes from one person
    concluding remarks  
Every game type is evolving and evolving, even the smallest. Roguelite provides a new idea for the development of the game market. We can find a little shadow of roguelite in many independent games or even 3A masterpieces we usually play. Although it is a mode full of infinite possibilities, it should never be a shield to block the rough game. Even the best knife should play in its most appropriate place The biggest effect is that it's not realistic to use a crosshead screwdriver to screw a word screw. In a good direction, roguelite has successfully entered the public's field of vision by following the trend, completely separated from the small circle, and has the opportunity to let more players feel its charm.
