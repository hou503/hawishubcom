Markus person, who players call "the creator"
Notch was born in Sweden, one of the five northern European countries. There is a small town named espin in the vast forest. The size of this town is not small, but it has a population of about 4000. When I was a child, notch was introverted. Children from other families all went out to play football and games in groups. Notch preferred to stay alone in the room and play with his LEGO toys. When notch was seven years old, his father brought a Commodore 128 personal computer back home, which made notch feel like a treasure. The computer became notch's favorite partner besides toys.

Commodore 128 PC
In my world's autobiographical novel, notch's childhood life is described as follows: when he was a child, notch often asked for leave to play computer games and learn to program on his own because of illness. At the age of 12, his parents divorced. There was only his father and sister in the family. His father was drunk and addicted to amphetamines (an anti fatigue drug), while his sister was addicted to drugs Pin chose to run away from home. Although the family situation was not very good, his mother was always very concerned about his son. Notch didn't even finish high school and was at home. His mother knew that she liked programming, so she suggested that he use the Internet to learn programming courses at home, hoping that he could have the conditions to pursue his dream in the future. After learning, 24-year-old notch joined king, the game developer of candy legend, for four years. In these four years, notch not only participated in many game development from the company, but also undertook many other projects, the most famous of which is MMORPG game Wurm online.

Sandbox MMORPG Wurm Online
# virtual sandbox
With King's reputation in the game industry not rising and the company's scale gradually expanding, notch rarely has the opportunity to undertake these "extra fast" private jobs. In notch, his freedom is limited, so he decided to quit and try to make a game himself. Notch hopes to make a sandbox game similar to dwarf fortress, and even the name is a salute game. The game is mainly played by reclaiming mines. At the same time, players can collect resources and use the materials at hand to randomly build various buildings in the game world, just like the Lego building blocks he played as a child.
In only one week, this prototype version has been completed. Due to the limited technical force, the content of the game is somewhat different from the version envisaged by notch. This is a 3D world composed of cubes, which should be a sandbox game in essence, but the players can do very little in this game, just like building blocks, it will be different It's just a random combination of material blocks, so notch released his work to TIG source to try to communicate with other netizens and players in technology, which is the first public version of the game, 0.0.11a.

The opinions given by the community determine the future trend of the game to a great extent, such as providing all the squares in the game to the players for arbitrary creation, or adding exploration elements to make it a survival oriented adventure game. In later versions, notch added the concept of alternation of day and night, collecting materials as much as possible during the day to build various facilities, with the purpose of resisting the attacks of monsters at night. From a certain point of view, these designs not only have the feeling of survival game, but also have the style of "Legend of Zelda" series as a whole. Because notch's artistic skill is not good, he is very handy to use the game style of pixel style material and cube. After several adjustments and modifications, the game is just trying to play It's a little interesting.
What is worth mentioning most is that since all the things in the game are presented in the image of cube, the player can regard each cube as a pixel point, so with the help of the construction mode, the player can use the cube of any material to build at will.

Notch didn't invest a penny in the promotion of the game. Thanks to its active and game forums from the beginning, it has attracted a considerable number of people's attention. The game, which is still to be improved, and the first public version went online soon after, began to sell at a price of $6.00. Almost every day, hundreds of people pay for this seemingly novel game. With a little money, notch established mojang with his colleague Jacob poser in King studio, which means "gadget" in Swedish.
"My world" is like a virus, which is constantly expanding its audience, gradually spreading from the Internet to all parts of the world. At first, notch wanted to use the money he was coming to pay for one or two people's follow-up updates and improvements with the help of the game. But now this scene is something he never dreamed of. When he has influence and income, he naturally needs to speed up the tour Only one or two people are not enough to update the play, and the far-reaching income has burst his paypal for a while, limiting the transaction.

"My world" became a hit in a flash. The main work of the studio in the later stage was all around the update and revision of the game. Its creative playing methods and infinite possibilities made it an independent game suitable for the young and the old. With the deepening of the update, the game itself was no longer attached to the surface content. The addition of mechanism and red stone circuit made it possible to The game is full of many physical elements, and even the role of education and entertainment.
For children, in this game, they can not only learn a lot of knowledge, but also connect with the practical application of common sense of life. Therefore, many parents are very relieved to let their children try this game. Now, the total sales volume of my world is about to exceed 200 million, which is closely followed by the depth of Tetris. It is impossible for anyone to imagine that a game made by heart can achieve such success. The success of "my world" has attracted the attention of big companies, and its own value can not be underestimated. The rich Microsoft directly offered us $2.5 billion to purchase the ownership of mojang studio and "my world", and in the face of such a high price, notch is also a very dry and crisp decision to sell the company.

End of       
Why does notch do this? Maybe it's because he grew up in a poor family and lived a poor life. He wanted a large sum of money enough for him to spend the rest of his life enjoying happiness. After selling the company, notch also left the company to live a happy life. With this huge sum, he bought a $70 million mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. This mansion is very popular with a number of international superstars. It can see the Pacific Ocean from the center of Los Angeles all the time.

Notch's Mansion
However, with money, notch doesn't seem to live the happy life he expected. He finds that he is still reluctant to part with my world for the company he created by himself. It's like a lovelorn feeling. Although he gets what he wants most, he also loses what is most important to him at the same time.
