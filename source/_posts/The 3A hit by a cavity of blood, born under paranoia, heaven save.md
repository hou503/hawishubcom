For a long time, the game works with medieval historical themes are very small in the whole field of video games, but in this field, we can also see many excellent works, such as the RPG works with extremely strong vitality, horse riding and killing series, or the real-time strategic game fortress series, which is dedicated to restoring the castle's offensive and defensive war Even now, the product may be regarded as a masterpiece in addition to some outdated pictures. The core of this theme is to let players experience the real history in history, so the key point is "reality".

There are not many works to carry out this in the end. The reason why the above works are outstanding is mainly due to the highly restoration of the real middle ages. However, there are only a few serious 3A scale works that can be found. But it doesn't mean that there is no such a typical RPG game as the kingdom of heaven: salvation, but it's amazing that the work that looks like 3A can't be more than 3A actually comes from an independent studio.

# small workshops have great advantages
About eight years ago, in a bar in Prague, the Czech capital, two men were planning to make some "big moves", which may be the most important decision for them in their life. The two men planned to set up a game studio, and tried to gather all the excellent local video game producers together to develop a middle world video game In view of the original intention of the company, they gave the studio a very suitable name: warhorse. Although the studio has been established for more than eight years, and only one game has been launched, the two men who set up the studio are not simple. One is Daniel vavla, who has ten years of experience in game production before. He once worked in the Czech branch of 2K developer, and the first two works of the famous retro open world action game "brothers of the four seas" It's from him; the other is Martin Krama, who previously worked in the interaction between codmaster and Bohemia and participated in the development of operation flash point and armed assault.

All the friends who have played know that with the high-quality production quality, the first two works of the four seas Brothers series have a high popularity in the game circle. This game also makes a lot of income for 2K, and Daniel, the producer, also makes a lot of money from it, but he is not happy about it, but he still feels tired of it, because it seems to him that the atmosphere of a large company It's not suitable for him. He thinks that all the tasks assigned to him by the company are not what he would like to do. Although Daniel has done them well, if he can arouse his creative desire, these works can even go to a higher level.
In Daniel's mind, he always wanted to make a realistic RPG with medieval themes, and it must be the kind of open world and hard core system. However, we need to know that although there are not a few game developers in Europe, especially independent game companies, so the video game industry is relatively developed, but it seems not so comfortable in the Czech Republic alone. There are only a few game manufacturers in this place, so it is not easy to recruit investors for this just started studio.

In 2011, the video game industry is in a tuyere period. Many small and medium-sized studios have been either acquired or closed. However, for zhanma, a newly established studio, the prospect is not optimistic. Publishers and investors are very afraid to take risks. There will be people who are interested in Daniel's project, but most of them have never been in the game field. Either they suggest Daniel not to make such a large-scale product, but to make a more profitable online game or hand game. For warhorses, this work is of great significance to them, so they do not want to These unsuitable investors have ruined the future of the game. Daniel visited major game publishers all over the world, and also looked for many investors. This search lasted for two years. In these two years, all kinds of expenses almost consumed Daniel's savings, and even the studio could not continue. This made Daniel once fell into despair. Maybe he had to find a new job to make a living.

Daniel with white head
As described in other stories, there should always be a timely rain at this time to save the protagonist of the story, as well as the war horse studio. Just as Daniel was about to decide to give up his business career, their works were appreciated by a Czech rich man named Zdenek bakala, who decided to give seed financing to the war horse studio, which was regarded as a kind of Make a big bet of your own. This made Daniel ecstatic, then began to continue his plan, he used the money to build the studio, and began to enter the development stage of the game. As mentioned above, Daniel's ambition is very huge. He wants to make a hard core game as real as possible. Every element in the game has appeared in the history, and the picture of the game must fit the times. He wants to make not only a world, but also a complete representation of history in the game, and let the players play with a The identity of nobody lives and takes risks in this world.

Early concept map
# strong unsatisfactory
However, two years later, the game is still in the early stage of development. Due to Daniel's excessive pursuit of the details of the game, he has to add a variety of systems and mechanisms from the beginning of making the game demo, such as the length of the players' meals and sleep, etc., and continue to polish them, so that in the early stage, he spent all the money given by the rich. Obviously, Daniel has a very huge ambition, if according to his imagination, it will be a large-scale 3A work, and the studio has only about 30 people and the economy is not sufficient, which is undoubtedly fantastic. Fortunately, their demo has reached the level of public release, so they decided to seek the help of the players and started crowdfunding on the Internet, with a goal of 500000 dollars. "If this goal cannot be achieved, then as those companies say, this game has no market, and we will give up this game," Daniel said.

The current members of warhorse studio
The game raised more than Â£ 1.1 million, more than four times the original target, and became the third game project in 2014 when KickStarter platform received funds. After that, warhorse studio got a second round of financing from the Czech rich man, so they finally had enough money to complete their vision. After four years of development, the game finally appeared in the sales interface of the store. If it starts from the project approval, the game took seven years to complete. The game is called "heaven: save". It sold 1 million sets in just half a month after its launch, creating at least $50 million in revenue for the studio. Just like the name of the studio, it became the first "war horse" in 2018.

2018 heaven: saving
Although the effect of the game is considerable, the reputation of the game itself is very polarized. The good thing is that the game has a very real restoration for all aspects, including people's life style and clothing matching, and even the combat system is also very realistic. Although it doesn't look handsome or even a little clumsy, every move has a relevant experience According to historical records, even in modern times, a martial art named HEMA has developed.
At the beginning of the game's sale, the bug and optimization of the game were also criticized by the players. Even in the eyes of many players, the game seemed to be unfinished. The whole game's playing method was similar to the imitation version of "horse riding and killing" and "ancient scroll". Due to the strong pursuit of truth, the difficulty of the game was relatively high. For many operation levels The players who are not good at it are not friendly.

    concluding remarks  
In my opinion, although the game "heaven: save" has a very close look to 3A works, it is only a kind of existence between 3a and independent games in essence. From the perspective of development industry, this is a "medieval" simulator with combat system, so the evaluation of the game is still acceptable and will not make people feel that there is anything wrong. The need for Tucao is Daniel's style of work. Obviously, this game is absolutely not bad, but without the help of the rich, the game will never be done again.

Cryngine used in the game is not easy for everyone to control
Daniel's ambition is a very good thing. This kind of spirit of playing games when he can't afford to eat is really admirable. However, his ambition is to rise to the sky step by step. After all, although the employees are all experienced people, the studio is brand-new after all. He walks steadily and slowly step by step. It's better to try small-scale works and consolidate the foundation of the studio Appropriate practices. Frankly speaking, the success of this game is attributed to those who have helped them. Fortunately, this game has been successful in the end. Otherwise, whether the studio can still have today is still unknown. The strength of warhorse studio can't be underestimated, but I hope that they can make steady progress in the future, otherwise they will eventually fall into a rush In the mire.
