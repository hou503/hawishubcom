On November 27, American game company EA, its studio rebirth entertainment and Lucas film, the producer of science fiction movie star wars, jointly announced that its latest game, Star Wars Jedi: the fallen Samurai regiment, has become the most popular Star Wars game with the highest initial sales volume in history. At the same time, EA launched the best opening sales volume after reaching cooperation with Disney Star Wars.

Recently, it has been a carnival for fans of Star Wars. First, the movie star wars: Mandalorians, which has been widely acclaimed, was officially launched, and then the game Star Wars Jedi was highly praised. Next month, the movie star wars 9 will be launched to usher in the official completion of the new Trilogy. Although the discussion degree of Star Wars Series in China is not very high, its reputation is resounding all over the world. Many people thought that "Star Wars Jedi" dared to sell at the same time as "death ran aground" for fear that the sales volume would die suddenly. In fact, they were slapped in the face. But to be fair, the success of "Star Wars Jedi" on the one hand has the support of IP, and On the other hand, the quality of the game itself is really excellent.

It is difficult to make a mistake.
EA signed a 10-year cooperation agreement with Disney, the copyright holder of star wars, as early as 2013. Since then, only EA has the qualification to develop Star Wars games. "Star Wars" series of games have appeared since the last century when video games were still in yadali period, but these games were not brilliant in that period when the film and television adaptation games were extremely rampant. EA did not invest in the development of related large-scale games after receiving "Star Wars" IP, but took the lead in launching a low-cost mobile game called "Star Wars: Galaxy and Britain" Xiong.

Star Wars: Galactic Heroes
Although mobile games made a lot of money for EA, the reputation of the game was not ideal. At that time, EA was carrying a lot of stigma. Two years later, dice, EA's "Pro son" studio, took over the development of "Star Wars" game, and developed "Star Wars: the front line" on the scale of her own brand game "battlefield", which is also the first time that the "Star Wars" series of games presented in front of players in a 3A posture.

Star Wars: the front
In fact, although there are many fans of star wars, those who like to watch movies may not like to play games. After all, people who like star wars are no longer young. Some of them have never touched games since they contacted Star Wars. Therefore, although the popularity of film and television works is quite high, the performance of the game is very common. To a large extent, because the IP influence is too large, fans expect too much of the game, and then because of too many times of disappointment, they gradually lose confidence in the game series.
Even though the screen performance and battlefield atmosphere of Star Wars: the front line are well shaped, the depth and content of the game in various systems are a little thin, which leads to the game's lack of popularity, which is still the same and fails to meet the players' ideal standards. For developers, holding such a large amount of IP also means paying for expensive copyright fees. In today's low-cost and high heat environment, this form of paying first and then making money is obviously no longer popular, which is why games adapted with famous IP are no longer common in recent years.

Star Wars: Frontline 2

Although the purchase price of copyright is very expensive, it is not a venture capital. Holding the copyright means that it can attract a group of fans in any case, at least ensure the sales volume of the game, and even save a sum of advertising costs. For a big IP like star wars, which is famous all over the world, the revenue is multiplied. The performance of two generations of works in Star Wars: front line series is not ideal, even EA's reputation has declined because of the content purchased in the second generation. Many players and media even attack EA online: EA does not deserve the IP of Star Wars.

In terms of EA, the public opinion of the hard to top players was later cancelled, and the open world Star Wars stand-alone game that had been handed over to EA Vancouver studio was under development. To a large extent, those who took over the development of the game were also hard to respond to the fans' expectations, and a little carelessness would inevitably lead to failure. Many people think that the so-called IP adaptation game is to serve the fans who like the relevant IP independently, which is not only in the view of the players, but also in the view of many game developers. Therefore, most of these games only need to work hard on the parts expected by the players, and it's no harm to make them rough in other places. Obviously, this is not the case A correct theory.
Although the world outlook and setting of Star Wars series are not complicated, they are also very large. It is not difficult to understand them, but it will take a long time to fully understand them. Therefore, Star Wars Jedi is not a game that passers-by can easily enter the pit. Its background setting and plot are closely related to the movie plot, and many settings in the game are consistent with the movie. Only those who have seen the movie can get the best game experience, while passers-by players may feel confused. This kind of feeling is like playing wizard 3 without playing the first two works of wizard. If you come out with a person with great weight in the previous work, you will not know who he is, so you will not feel the wonderful shaping of this bridge.

The core role of wizard 3, the king of wild hunting, is an important role since the second generation
In the history of game development, there are not many adapted games that can be called masterpieces, but almost every one can be regarded as a classic. For example, Batman: Arkham series, as a superhero game adapted from comics, is called the best adapted game in history by numerous fans. The reason why it can get such evaluation is that the design of the game is very considerate For players who don't know much about Batman, there are detailed descriptions of the relevant stories and character building of several main characters. Even the weapons Batman uses in the battle are easy to understand. They focus on Batman's own characteristics and the combination with the game content, giving players a sense that they are "playing" Batman rather than "controlling" Batman , in order to enhance the experience of the game rather than purely meet the expectations of fans, and "Star Wars Jedi" also achieved the same effect, will be recognized by the players.

The peak of Batman game city of Arkham
In short, "Star Wars Jedi" meets all the expectations of a Star Wars fan for the adaptation of the game. The characters in the movie can kill the enemy with their lightsabers in handsome moves, or shoot back the laser from the enemy, use the force to hold the enemy's throat and push down the cliff, or even use lightsabers to illuminate in dark places. These experiences can be realized in the game Now, it completely restores the experience of a real Jedi warrior, which rarely appeared in previous games.

Running on the wall has the shadow of "Titan falls"
Many successful adaptation game cases have been placed in front of the players, so the players will have a fixed measurement for the evaluation standard of adaptation game, whether it is simply as a fan to know the consumption feelings of the game at a glance, but in front of those well-known IP, whether the audience group they belong to can remain rational is another matter. I hope to see more adaptation games with high quality and experience like Star Wars Jedi in the future. After all, consumer sentiment is not a sustainable development path.
