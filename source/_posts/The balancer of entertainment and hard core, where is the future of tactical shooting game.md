Shooting games have always been very popular with male players. Although they may not be as popular as MoBa in today's electric game field, they have a wide range of styles and a large number of people in each type. Together, they can definitely surpass MoBa. With the development of time, shooting game is no longer the same as in the early years, as long as there is no brain to see the enemy to shoot, players' tastes gradually become tricky, too casual and uninteresting, too hard core to start with is too difficult and not fun, and what is more appetizing to people is often the existence between the two, and this type of shooting game we usually call "tactical shooting" Games.

Compared with the traditional competitive games, tactical shooting games usually emphasize the cooperation between team members, shooting is not the most critical factor to determine the outcome, the division of labor between members and the use of props are more important, the use of tactics and the use of temporary decisions can turn to win most of the time. Because of the variety of playing methods of tactical shooting games, the mechanism of operation and system should be more complex. If you want to play well, you can't spend a lot of time to practice and get familiar with it.

#The originator of the mountain
Now when it comes to tactical shooting games, many people think of the popular Rainbow Six: siege, Rebellion: Desert Storm and other works at the first time. Considering that the historical year of color six: siege is the most senior and popular among many works, many people will directly equate color six: Siege with tactical shooting games, or even straight Then Rainbow Six as the open source of tactical shooting game. In fact, the rainbow six series does have a lot to do with the shaping of this game category, but its concept has been born a long time ago: as early as the 1980s, micro prose, a game company founded by gold medal game producer Sid Meyer and former Air Force pilot Billy stilly, was an unknown gamer before making the civilization of SID Meyer The studio is a professional in military simulation. Influenced by the avid pilot, most of the company's games at first focused on simulation flight, and then gradually derived the branch works of ground war and individual combat.

Microprose works
In 1987, Microprose launched a shooting game called "airborne Ranger". In order to restore the difficulty of airborne combat, players should be prepared in advance before the battle begins. At the same time, players can only carry a limited amount of ammunition, so how to manage ammunition reasonably Finishing the task by the way is the biggest challenge of the game. Before that, the shooting games were always like "soul battle" or "red fortress", which only need to see people to open fire, without brain outburst to solve the battle. There are few games that need to control the amount of ammunition, while the games like "airborne commando" that need to be carefully calculated are definitely the first time. Although the game itself is not very good, but its concept is very novel for several other game manufacturers to provide a new inspiration.

In 1998, time has come to the trend of 3D video games. Red strom entertainment, founded by Tom Clancy, a famous military novelist, launched a counter-terrorism simulation shooting game to restore the special forces to save hostages. This game is the first generation of rainbow six. In this work, the task is not something that can be completed by one person. As the team leader of the anti-terrorism team, players need to plan the action route and order of each team member before performing each task, and assign corresponding equipment to them. Because the death of the players is permanent, the process of the game is usually half an hour of tactical arrangement and only five minutes of fighting. Only constant trial and error can ensure that the players can successfully complete the task in a relatively safe situation.

1998 Rainbow Six
The first work of rainbow six has achieved a very good reputation and evaluation. However, due to its overall high difficulty and relatively hard playing method, which tests the patience and logical thinking of the players, the sales volume of the game can only be called fair, but it also meets the small needs of some good military lovers. Because of its strict hard core setting, and the self positioning of the work given by its own card, it is "tactical shooting game". Since then, the concept of "tactical shooting game" has always followed Rainbow Six, becoming its core design concept. With rainbow six perfecting the game type of "both hard and soft", other types of anti-terrorism tactical shooting games have begun to appear on the market, such as delta Special Forces, which was popular in Chinese Internet cafes in the north and south of the Yangtze River in the early years, SWAT (thunderbolt team), even anti-terrorism elites (though they are the easiest to start with) It was born in such a big environment.

With the development of time and the accumulation of time, as well as the cooperation between Tom Clancy and Ubisoft, it seems that all the heat of "tactical shooting game" has been dominated by Ubisoft for a while. There are not only rainbow six in the first person, but also operation ghost in the third person. Although the series of "SWAT" by Sierra is based on The old sequel is being launched, but the heat has never been able to compete with Ubisoft. As for delta Special Forces on the other side, it has started its endless self abandonment. The problems of the game itself are not repaired, and the development technology is always backward, which can be said to be a real gnawing at the old book. At the same time, the only popular one is anti terrorist elite, because of its low threshold and The main way to play the multi player game makes it more inclined to competitive shooting games, so it has become a competitive FPS game with only a few elements of "tactical shooting game".

1999 counter terrorism elite
Today, even "anti terrorist elite" has experienced two sequels, and now it has become the most popular FPS competitive game in the world. Rainbow Six has also changed from the original hard core single player game to the antagonistic tactical shooting game, from the original "solo music" to "fighting with people for fun". Although there are some twists and turns in the transformation process But it has achieved good results in the end, and now it has become "the most fun FPS competitive game". The rumor that "SWAT" will launch a new work has been circulating throughout the game circle, but as for when it will be released, it is unknown. In the near future, there will be a hard core tactical shooting game called "ready or not". This game was once regarded as the spiritual sequel of "SWAT". It has been greatly improved both in the picture and in the playing method. It is very expected to watch the game demonstration alone.

    concluding remarks  
Thanks to several "old masters", the excellent game mode of "tactical shooting" has been recognized and accepted by more players, and has always been active in the front-line field. Maybe this is the attitude that an excellent game type should have. Maybe in the future, we can see that tactical shooting games can evolve again on the basis of existing ones, but this is another story.
