In any field, there is always a question: if one day the world is destroyed and you survive, what will you do? There are different answers to this topic, but one thing we can be sure of:   no one knows how the world will be destroyed, after all, no one has ever lived in the end. For a long time, works related to eschatology have been active in various fields. It is precisely because of the unknown of eschatology that many works related to eschatology have been derived.

It's hard not to think of the "wasteland" when it comes to the "end of the world". In the film and television industry, we have "2012" and "the day after tomorrow", which are not masterpieces, but are called classic films. In the field of video games, there are more works that can be called names. For a long time, these self-contained works have naturally derived a new cultural category, which is called "waste land culture".
The waste soil culture has been continuously improved over time. Although the waste soil culture can be said to be the most understandable and clear one among all kinds of cultural categories in the shaping of world outlook, a common concept has not been jumped out from the beginning to the end: Although the waste soil is cool, no one would expect such a day to come.
      
There is no fixed definition of waste soil culture. As long as it has experienced natural and man-made disasters and human civilization has disintegrated, it can be called waste soil, and waste soil has also derived a variety of different styles, both retro and future. If the works that can represent the category of "cyberpunk" are the "blade killer" series, the works that can represent the wasteland culture will undoubtedly mention "Mad Max".
Crazy Max was born in 1979. Director George Miller never made any film before shooting crazy max. he won the best director award of Australian Film Academy with this film. At first, no one was very optimistic about the film, because its description of violence and sex was not taboo, too straightforward, and was criticized by people from all walks of life. What's funny is that as a "rotten film", it is well-known, its reputation is great, and there will be more people who naturally pay attention to it, and it's just because there are so many people watching it that its depth and internal are mined by the media and the masses Come out.

The man's classic black leather coat with dog shape is available in many games and movies
Mad Max of the early generation is not a pure wasteland movie, but more like a police and bandit movie. The main background time of the movie is placed in the bleak near future. The civilized society is still alive but crumbling, though not wasteland, it is almost wasteland. And from the beginning of the sequel, the world view of the film is gradually starting to unfold, becoming a world full of diesel and gunpowder. In the cost limit, the film production is relatively rough, but the director has turned this into his own advantage. After all, there were not many realistic style works of video games at that time, and later works paid too much attention to the special effects production of the film, while the ordinary and unadorned Mad Max became the most eye-catching one, in which the wearing of the protagonist, the various designs in the waste soil Will also lay a large foundation for related works.

So that it has launched its own adaptation game of the same name
#From waste soil to radiation
In 1988, interplay produced an RPG game called wasteland, which was released by EA company. The emergence of "wasteland" broke the stereotyped theme of "sword and magic" in RPG game in the game market. The background of "wasteland" was set in the west of the United States after the nuclear war. As mentioned above, human civilization in the game was almost extinct, without legal and moral constraints, and everywhere was burning, looting and looting In order to prevent these villains from doing evil, some people spontaneously stand up and express their willingness to repair all these things. They set up a team that has been specially dealing with these groups. Its name is "desert Ranger". The main role of the player is the leader of the desert Ranger, who manages waste land and water fires.

The first generation of "waste soil" has been reprinted in high definition
The highlight of the game is that players can explore in this wasteland at will and get involved in various events. There are no black or white forces and organizations in the whole world, and the choices made by players are often in the gray area between them. The super freedom and rich content of the game are bound to prove that this is not a bad game. The game won numerous awards, and also won the best RPG award of the year.
After the success of the game, it is natural to launch a sequel to maintain the popularity of the game, but it is helpless that the copyright of the game is in EA's hands, so interplay decided to be its own publisher to launch a spiritual sequel for the waste land series, and this game is the world-famous RPG work fallout. Later, the series of "waste soil" was developed by crowdfunding, and "waste soil 3" at this year's E3 exhibition finally indicated that it would be released next spring.

The style of radiation is slightly different from that of waste land, but the background is also after the nuclear war. Radiation adopts a very unique retro science fiction style and is full of black humor. Although radiation is not so depressing in the overall atmosphere, it is not easy to go anywhere. On the contrary, the addition of black humor elements makes every plot in the game more hairy Bone is terrified. No matter the setting, the system or the style, radiation perfectly explains what is called "single tree and one grid". It is from then on that time that a variety of other "wasteland" works began to appear on the market. So far, four orthodox works and one kind of derivative and external works have been launched by the palace of radiation series, which has become the synonym of "waste land game" in the game circle.

The more new you make, the better radiation: New Vegas is

After radiation, we can also see such realistic style game works as sneaker and subway. They all like to put the background of the game behind the nuclear war, from which we can find the intention: the producer hopes to greatly improve the sense of substitution of the players through a relatively realistic background. Since the realistic style of walking can never say that the earth is out of the world Starmen attacked this science fiction setting.
In these works, players usually face a variety of choices. For example, if you save someone, this person will give you money, but obviously this person needs more money than you do. Do you want to collect or not? There are many nuclear war shelters in radiation. On the surface, these shelters are for the purpose of accepting refugees. In fact, all the shelters are secretly carrying out various experiments on human beings. Most of the time, these experiments will make people become turtles in a jar and suffer from the treatment of life is not like death.

Although no one has experienced the cruelty of waste land, we can only experience it in the virtual world through games, but the plots described in these games are not impossible to happen. The more in danger, the more real people can be reflected. In the world without laws and constraints, what kind of results can be imagined. From another perspective, the game All the plots in are to express people's fear of war and thinking about human nature.
In the final analysis, although the waste soil culture is very attractive, including the author's love, but waste soil is not a yearning existence. If there is such a day, even how to play "prevention needle", it will waver in the face of choice. Some people do not know how many people are looking forward to the end of the world, and feel that they can show their skills at that time When all suffering is defeated in front of you, you will regret your ignorance more and more.
