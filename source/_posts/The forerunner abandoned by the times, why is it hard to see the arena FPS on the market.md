In today's video games and fields, first person shooting games have long been a common category of games. Almost every other short period of time, large factories and small factories from all over the world have launched works of different styles. At present, FPS games are more popular in competitive games and have their own one acre and three points. Although they may not be as hot as all kinds of MoBa games, they win In a variety of styles, but also in the field of competitive games occupy a large share.

At present, FPS has many different types. They have different playing methods and rhythms. There are tactical shooting types that emphasize the randomness of tactical collocation, and there are also classical types that shoot and explode everything with a big weapon. However, it's not surprising that there is such a type that many people may have contact with him, and there are many people who have heard the representative works under this type, but in today's game market, this kind of game works are almost on the brink of extinction. Do you remember where the word "rocket jump" came from? Do you know what kind of game made that "German boy" smash the keyboard? It's called the arena FPS, or AFP for short.

Before the birth of G Pang's half life, most FPS games on the market basically had no plot. At that time, doom, led by id software, was the leader in the whole FPS game field. In the view of the players at that time, as a "cool is done" shooting game, the plot really didn't care much about anything. What the players need to do in doom is to control the protagonist to explore in the map and find the way out of each map. Just point your weapons at the monsters and enemies on the way and pull the trigger. Basically, everything that will appear in front of you and move will pose a threat to you. A major feature of this series is that the protagonist does not need to load bullets for the weapons in his hands, but different weapons need different types of ammunition. Only if there is ammunition in reserve, you can finish it all at once. Because the action is the short board of this work, producer John Romero shot part of the gap (though horizontal) that can be crossed by using rocket launchers in the map, which is the origin of "rocket jumping".

1993 the destroyer
The more kinds of weapons the protagonist can get, the more complex they will be in the later stage. At first, there are pistols, shotguns, chainsaws and so on. At the later stage, they can get Gatling, rocket launchers and BFG, which can clear the screen. They can let the players immerse themselves in the fancy killing of the enemy. In short, the core of the game is to let the players through the smart movement and the characteristics of using each weapon flexibly, just need to find a way to wipe out the enemy, and from the beginning of the works, the game supports multi player online battle, playing method and single machine mode have been completely all the time, but the enemy of the player is also the player, and it is precisely because of this, these characteristics can be achieved in the player's To the greatest extent. In doom, players will fight in a closed map. Although the action composition is not high, they can also try to play some small tactics, such as squatting beside the weapon or walking around the path quickly. This is the origin of the type of AFP game. Several players fight with each other in a closed arena, so it is named arena FPS.

In 1998, id software launched a new FPS "quake" with real 3D screen, playing the same way as "doom", and the biggest change compared with "doom" is that the main character added jumping in the game, but just adding a jump can make the core digging method of the play more possible. This work also supports many people to fight, better picture and better operation feel, which makes this work quickly replace the scenery of doom. At the same time, this work has a very high open source, which allows players to participate in the modification of the game and make new content. Therefore, some players start to make other game modes in this work, the most popular and influential mode is to seize Capture the flag, the player needs to grab the flag of the other team from the map and bring back the score of our camp to get the score. At the same time, we must organize the local members to take away our flag. It is a bit like adding a sport to FPS. This mode has been circulating so far, and has evolved into a variety of versions, which will appear in most confrontational FPS games.

1996 hammer of thunderbolt
The hammer of thunder series has launched many works subsequently, and each of them is constantly updated and improved. The multiplayer mode of the series is also more perfect than the other. By the time of three generations, it is more direct to make a pure multiplayer game, which is enough to see that id software attaches great importance to the multiplayer mode of the series, and the influence of this series is also constantly improving. The popularity of "hammer of thunderbolt" has made other manufacturers see red eyes. They want to share a share in the same way. If they want to defeat the king, they must first obtain the same strength as the king. But it is undoubtedly the simplest way to directly refer to the mode of "hammer of thunderbolt". With this thinking, epic game, the developer of the unreal engine, launched the series of "unreal arena" and "Thunderbolt" Hammer 3 was released only ten days later.
Virtual arena was developed with the help of digital extremes, a Canadian studio. Most of the weapons were designed by them. Thanks to the integration of game modes, the novelty design of weapons and the openness of maps, this "integrated" work soon caught up with hammer of thunderbolt and became two of the FPS competitive games at that time Big oligarch, let "German boy" gas to hit the keyboard is this work.

Once upon a time, most of the adversary FPS adopted this kind of fast-paced AFPs mode, which focuses on personal skills and technology. Considering that these games usually require quick response and operation of players, but it is not easy for the handle to achieve this effect. In addition, at that time, the design of the host FPS game was not mature, so the AFPs has only been used for a long time Active only on PC platform. Until 2001, halo, a FPS game specially developed by Bungie for the early Xbox, broke this situation. Since 2000, every developer has begun to focus on the host platform, and halo, as a science fiction FPS, contains a multi person mode, which can be said to have quite revolutionary significance. Halo reduces the speed and rhythm of the game, and designs the operation mode of the game's handle as comfortable as possible. It only retains the mode in the traditional APFs, but it is closer to a modern FPs in playing method. It not only makes it possible for the host to play competitive FPS, but also allows more people to have the opportunity to join the camp.

2001 halo
Halo brings new inspiration to the whole game industry. After all, the mainframe is a big fat meat. Whoever grabs it first will enjoy it first. He redefined the FPS of the mainframe, so the FPS on the market began to move closer to halo, including the later emergence of battlefield and call of Duty series. In addition to several FPS focusing on competition, the online content will be basically The rhythm has dropped. Of course, the traditional AFP, which is both painstaking and laborious, is no longer favored. So the game category just disappeared? In fact, the above two oligarchs are also persisting in launching new works later. However, for game developers, these works are no longer popular, so they are only for a small number of players to make, and they don't need to make in a big way. In short, they have shifted the focus of development.

In 2014, epic announced the development of a new "virtual arena" work. This work was originally planned to be led by a 20 person team of epic, encouraging community players to participate in the game development together, and will adopt the materials produced by players in the future. With the popularity of the big escape game later, epic joined a big escape mode in his own failed work "night of the fortress". Unexpectedly, it suddenly caught fire, so he simply ordered all the staff of the development department to focus on "night of the fortress". As for this "unreal arena", there is no updated dynamic until today, and it still stays in the early development stage According to the official: because most of the original members are already the core development members of Fortress night, and the company is very confused about the future plan of the game, so we can only temporarily put the game development on hold. This situation is just like the previous few years' work "Paragon", which also came from epic and died, with a great probability of continuing.

2014 new unreal Arena
As for hammer of thunderbolt on the other side, after id software was acquired by Bethesda, the IP was temporarily put on hold for a period of time. During this period, ID participated in the development of rage, new destroyer, German headquarters and other works, and supported the classical FPS market with its own strength, making it rejuvenate. As for hammer of thunderbolt, ID launched a sub era version called hammer of thunderbolt: champion in 2017, and the mode and playing method of the game itself have been greatly reformed, adopting the role division settings like "watch the pioneer" and "Legion Fortress 2". Even the official said that the game was pushed to match the watch the pioneer series However, the old players who have been waiting for the new work are annoyed by doing so. After all, the game that starts with two hands and equipment depends on picking up is a series of tradition, adding the character system will undoubtedly lose its original flavor. In the same way, the development focus of community B and ID has basically shifted to the very successful "destroyer" in recent years. There is no one to take care of the quality of this free game. Today, more than two years later, this game is still in the "preemptive experience" stage.

    concluding remarks  
The decline of AFP games is largely related to the changes of the times, but it is undeniable that although their competitors are very strong, the developers take profit as the first goal and do not pay attention to this dying game type, which also accounts for a lot of responsibility. Maybe a lot of players grew up playing CS, and a lot of people came here playing hammer of thunder and unreal arena. In the latter's view, maybe these works not only have a strong appreciation, but also a fast-paced game environment is very suitable for long-term operation. The last round may be about the same time as a "landing into a box" Between. It's a pity that the glorious deeds of this great "forerunner" are so forgotten. I hope that these two oligarchs will get their "second life" one day. After all, there are many people who want to ask for an acceptable statement.
