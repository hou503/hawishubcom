In recent times, the most artistic game, of course, is "death stranded" by Hideki Oshima. Players who know Hideki Oshima may know that Hideki is a serious movie lover. He has always wanted to shoot a formal video film of his own, but because of his identity as a gamer, he has not been able to realize this dream, but as an art game The comprehensive product of art form is a good substitute, so the vast majority of the island's games like to use the form of expression similar to the film, and "stranded in death" is probably the closest game work in the style of the film in the history of the island.

In the early years, games and movies were always two unrelated forms of entertainment. However, with the continuous development of science and technology, the production quality of video games did not agree with the past. From the original pure entertainment products to today's "ninth art", which means that the distance between games and other art forms is shrinking, and the distance between games and movies is also shrinking. Some people want to make games into movies, while others want to make movies into games. At present, there are not a few such products, but they have never formed a complete combination of the two fields, and their final works will always tend to one of them.

# film Gamification
In the early years, the main game market focused on the home console and the arcade, in which the development speed of the home console may be a little faster than the arcade game. There was a "pixel war" in the golden age of home console games. Various manufacturers scrambled to upgrade their hardware specifications first. The 8bit screen seemed to be upgraded to 32bit screen in a flash, and the better the screen, the greater the capacity of the game. Therefore, it is difficult for the traditional cassette to load these games, and the CD-ROM has become the mainstream game to replace the cassette Medium of play.

Sega MD and Sega CD (Sega CD is an external device and cannot be used alone)
At that time, several home computers like to add a "CD" after the name of the host and the game to be used as a publicity gimmick, and it is at this time that the first video game "Dragon Cave Adventure" produced by FMV appeared.

The whole animation performance of "the adventures of Dragon Cave"
The so-called full motion video game refers to the game made by combining the video or animation clips recorded by real people, while "Adventures of Dragon Cave" is made by former Disney animator don Bruce, who is like making animation frame by frame. At first, the game was released on the arcade platform, and then transplanted to Sega CD and Amiga computer perfectly, although it seems to be made 10 times The game experience of players is like watching a Disney animation, but it's actually just a simple QTE game, which needs to help the protagonist avoid some attacks and obstacles. Although it seems that the production of this kind of game is time-consuming, laborious and expensive, in fact, it is much cheaper and easier than the previous game production. The animation drawing is basically the same process as the general animation production, while the real-life performance only requires a few actors to record several videos according to the requirements, and the final effect is also unsatisfactory, which is the initial "film / Animation The concept of "play".

Regardless of the theme and form of expression, the core selling point of these works is always the plot, and whether the production level is excellent or not is only used to better present the works. Then there appeared a more sophisticated form of expression, collectively referred to as "interactive films". For example, in recent years, the very popular "Detroit: changing people" or "invisible Guardian" can be called interactive films. On the surface, they are games, but in fact, regardless of the nature of the phenomenon, they are actually the same concept as the early "Adventures of Dragon Cave" , but the picture and fineness should be better.

3A interactive film Detroit: changing people
Take Detroit: changing people as an example. If the perfect ending of the game is taken as the end of the story and all other branch options are left aside, then it is just a 3D movie that tells the conflicts and disputes between people and bionic people. It has all the design and ideas that a movie should have. It just makes the story interactive after joining the option branch. This is also the point of developers They know it well, so they don't call their works "games". As for the popular interactive video, it is the same idea, but the latter is less difficult and cheaper to produce, but it also takes a lot of time to polish if you want to create excellent works.

# cinematization of games
In short, the so-called movie Gamification refers to the introduction of interactive system in the movie, which can give the player short-term operation power or make the player make a choice for the direction of the story, but its essence is still the plot as the main body, while the so-called "game Filmization" is just the opposite, its essence is always the game, but it has incorporated some movie design ideas. Exactly speaking, this kind of design idea will not affect the design concept of the game itself. At best, it will affect the game's form of expression and narrative techniques, so as to provide better game experience for the players. At the beginning of the article, I mentioned that most of the works of Xiufu Oshima adopted the design idea of film, and it seems that he was the first person who dared to try this form.

Although the island pursues literature and art excessively, it has good taste
After entering the 3D era of PS host, alloy equipment, a tactical espionage game made by Xiaodao Xiufu, uses a large number of real-time calculation and script animation forms in the game, which makes the plot performance effect of the game very vivid and has a sense of substitution, and has the feeling of movie in the experience. People who have played this series know that the plot of the game itself is excellent, and the performance effect is eye-catching, but the core of the game is still the stealth of tactical espionage, as for the cinematic performance form, it just plays a finishing point for the game itself.

Tactical espionage game alloy equipment solide
Then, the effect of script performance and real-time calculation began to be popular in the development industry, and with the improvement of game development technology, these techniques can create better effects in a better picture, of which the most well-known is FPS game "call of duty" series. Since the beginning of the series, "call of duty" has created a performance comparable to "Saving Private Ryan" by referring to a large number of war films, and then in the "modern war" series, it has created a script performance with great visual impact by using the characteristics of the first person perspective, just like the classic bridge in the film, which has created an irreplaceable one for the players Classic bridge sections.

How many people don't recognize the scene
In any case, most of the films are in the form of linear process, so it is undoubtedly the best choice to use in linear games, and the above-mentioned classic works are always based on linear games, and the current leader in this field is Sony's Naughty Dog Studio. Naughty dog's "mysterious sea area" series and "the last survivor" have adopted a lot of cinematic narrative techniques, and have a very good experience in the design of the lens and plot rhythm, rather than Xiaodao's obsession with "one mirror to the end". These two series not only hold the ups and downs of the plot and rhythm properly in the passage and the whole process, but also you can feel the rhythm of "Relaxation" in similar action movies at each level of each chapter, from gentle to rapid to intense and finally relaxed. The game is full of such a bridge to control the player's situation Xu, now put the player's game experience in the first place, and then in the design of pictures and music, there is no cutting corners, which is actually a collection of cinematic games.

Almost every player will take a deep breath and sigh when playing here, and turn on the camera mode
    concluding remarks  
To sum up, even though the two fields have different forms of interaction and combination, their own essence has never jumped out of the core, the game is always the game, and the movie is always the movie, even if there are different experiences and interaction ways, this is always the same. For developers, whether it's cinematic games or game movies, no one can be sure whether this is their complete body. Although the two have been organically combined in various forms, it seems that the cross-border development of the two has not stopped, and some people are still trying to find new possibilities. For example, the newly released "stranded in death" has re integrated more movie elements on the basis of the original cinematic narrative, as well as the role of a live all-star cast in the game. In the eyes of the uninformed outsiders, it may really regard "stranded in death" as a movie. This is undoubtedly a new beginning. Maybe we can see their "best match" in our lifetime.
