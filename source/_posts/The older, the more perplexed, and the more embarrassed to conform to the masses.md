Recently, in addition to lesha's Alchemy workshop, the most topical game works in the game circle, I'm afraid that the latest 3A masterpiece "action of the ghost: breakpoint" which Ubisoft touts is included. The former is more joking and expectation, while the latter is qingyishui's "bad comment". As for why "ghost action: breakpoint" suffered such a Waterloo like public praise slump, I believe that all the players who have a little knowledge of the game should know that there will be no more details here. For "breakpoint", players should also spray, and the limelight is almost over. This work has become the second worst work after "soul fighter: RC League" this year.

Interestingly, in combination with the development trend of the whole "ghost action" in the past and some development ideas of Ubisoft for its own games in recent years, it seems that the word-of-mouth death of "breakpoint" is also expected, and for the whole IP of "ghost action", it is indeed going downhill now. If "ghost action" wants to get on the right track, it's not difficult. It's only necessary to know where the problem is, when it comes out, who it comes out of and then modify it. It seems that the biggest problem of Ubisoft at present is that they don't know what the problem is. After all, even if the game is not good enough, it really makes them real gold.

#"Rainbow Six" in the valley
If you want to know what's wrong with ghost action, you need to start with his first story. Among the most popular FPS games nowadays, one of them is from Ubisoft. Its name is Rainbow Six: siege. Siege is probably the most viscous game work of the players since its establishment. Since this generation, they have developed siege on the scale of an e-competitive FPS and provided long-term and stable content updates Until now, there is still a very stable and huge group of players in the world, and the world-wide E-sports events are also very similar. Although the style of besiege is quite different from that of his previous works, it still doesn't get out of his core "tactical shooting game", which emphasizes more on the tactical cooperation between players than focusing on shooting techniques, and it's the day when Rainbow Six was born that makes it look very tall.

Rainbow Six: Siege
The first rainbow six was released in 1998, and shortly after it was released, red storm, the development team, started to develop another game. Unlike the indoor raid of rainbow six, this time they moved the game map to a larger field, and a special combat team went to the enemy's stronghold to carry out combat tasks that were not much different from rainbow six. This one The game is "ghost action".

Rainbow Six
The highlight of the first generation of "ghost action" is that players can immediately give instructions to AI teammates in the process of the game for tactical cooperation, and players can use any way to perform tasks unlimited, as long as they can achieve their goals, they can do whatever they want, without the restriction of "Rainbow six" to ensure the safety of hostages. But even so, players still need to be careful. After all, there are few enemies and their firepower is much lower than that of the enemy. How to finish the task smoothly under the condition of ensuring the safety of their own side is the most challenging play method of the series. The system design of the first generation of "ghost action" can be described by the word "hard core". In view of the hard core game has always been called good or not, the sales volume of the first generation of "ghost action" is not very high, although it has a good reputation, but it does exceed the company's expectations.

Operation ghost
#Small success
In the later works, red strom began to adopt the more common game design at present, which reduced the difficulty of the game, such as the characters on their own side can bear more damage, can be rescued by teammates after being injured instead of being paralyzed directly, cancel the setting of permanent death, and change the Perspective of the game to a more fashionable third person cross shoulder perspective. Compared with the early generation, the follow-up series "ghost action 2" and "ghost action: peak warrior" have more abundant action systems, which make the battle more refreshing and exciting. After all, there is no fixed game playing method in this series. Some people just don't want to slowly sneak with patience, so the development team specially strengthened the content beyond sneaking, but at the same time, it also made the greatest progress Degree retains the core of the original tactical cooperation content. In the game, it's easier and faster to give instructions to teammates in real time, rather than open the map and plan everything as before, which greatly improves the fluency of the game process, and "peak warrior" has become the most acclaimed work in the series.

Operation Ghost: the pinnacle Warrior
And the real work that most players start to contact with this series is "ghost action: Future Warrior", which is the first attempt of the series to bring the story background to the near future, and provides more sci-fi weapons and equipment, such as optical camouflage and thermal perspective equipment, which can be used by their own side. The cool art style has been used in Hollywood movie style script performances For the players left a deep impression, although the media evaluation of this work is not as good as the previous work, but its influence is not less than the same period of "quality effect", and this time the host version performance finally boasted, there was a time when "future fighter" was also one of the most popular multiplayer online games on the host.

Operation Ghost: Future Warrior
# keep pace with the times
From the beginning to the end, this series takes semi open world design as the tradition, making each map small, precise and solid. In 2017, after five years, Ubisoft launched its most ambitious generation of works, ghost action: wilderness, which is the first time in the series to use the open world, and contains a scaled down map of Bolivia, the scale of which is beyond the reach of many games at that time. However, at that time, Ubisoft indulged in a highly repetitive "formulaic open world". Although there was a large-scale and beautiful map, we could roughly divide the map into several small pieces, and the content of each small piece was almost the same. From the main line to the branch line to the collection of elements and random events, it seemed that there were only differences in environment and main factors The difference of the plot.

Ghost action: Wilderness
In short, Ubisoft wants players to experience super high freedom battle match with the help of the open world. In terms of playing style, it is similar to "alloy equipment 5: phantom pain", but there is a huge and beautiful map available. Although the core content of tactical shooting is perfect in essence, as an open world game, it is too empty. Besides, operation ghost Series to outdoor tactical shooting as a selling point, tactical choice of freedom is needed, but the open world is really not necessary. From the wilderness, we can see that Ubisoft is planning to establish a general setting of "Tom Clancy universe". The series of works adopt a fixed framework, including world outlook and character relationship, etc. the latest work breakpoint is such a work, just because the game itself wants to add various elements to highlight the concept of all aspects, but it is practical On the other hand, they didn't focus on any aspect and didn't perform well in any aspect. At the same time, they lost the core playing method of the ghost action series, which eventually led to the death of word-of-mouth of the game.

    concluding remarks  
As a long-standing game series with a history of nearly 20 years, "ghost action" has been trying to constantly improve since its first sequel and introduce more game elements that are more easily accepted by people at present. This has also been effective. After all, previous generations of works have achieved good results in sales volume and public praise, but they are not complacent Instead, they choose to try new things in every generation. Instead of inheriting the previous excellent design, they always want to be able to cross the existing achievements and move to a new field, but in the end, it backfires. Like Icarus in Greek mythology, they always want to fly higher, but fall into the sea because of melting their wings.

It's a good thing to add pop elements to the old game, but it's not a bad thing to keep the original core all the time. From the development cycle of breakpoint for only more than two years, we can know that this game may only be an accessory product created by reusing the previous materials, just like "Assassin's Creed: Xiao Xiong" is to "the great revolution", but from the preview of the game The core of breakpoint is not the game itself. It seems that they also know what the game is like, which is doomed to be a thunder work. But it's ironic that even though the word-of-mouth of breakpoint died, it still easily achieved sales of tens of millions. Ubisoft naturally has plans to launch a sequel, but we don't know what kind of changes they will make this time.
