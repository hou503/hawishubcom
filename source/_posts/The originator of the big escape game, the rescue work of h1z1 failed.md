The type of big escape game has been born for some time. Although its popularity has declined, it has never faded out of the players' vision. It is largely related to the segmentation of multiple games. Today's big escape game has changed from the original one to the present one. With the participation of many front-line manufacturers, the competition in this market is also fierce It became intense.

At present, there are many successful works, among which the most famous and discussed one is the well-known "survival of the Jedi". As an action shooting game, its influence is so great that many players who never contact with the game, especially the shooting game, are attracted into the pit. Regardless of the reputation, survival of the Jedi has made great success in business at least. But who can remember that there was a big hit before Jedi. Its name is h1z1, which is not strange to many players, but not many people will try the game again. Today, it has only 300 people a day and less than 200 people online. It seems that the end of the game has entered the countdown.

Now renamed "Z1 escape"
# great original
The game mode of "big escape" is not originated from the game, but from a Japanese horror novel named "big escape", which was later adapted into a movie and known to people. In this movie, a group of students are required to kill each other on an uninhabited island until one person survives, so as to cultivate a person with the perseverance to survive as a useful talent of the country.
Although the film is controversial all over the world, it is also a good quality work and has a certain influence all over the world. Born in Ireland and living in Brazil, Brandon green is a game mod author. He is also deeply influenced by the movie. He successively made the most important rules of the movie into mod and added them to the military sandbox simulation game "Armed Assault 2" and its sequel. Although this mode is more interesting, because of the extremely low popularity of "armed assault" and the extremely high difficulty of the game, only that Some players who like "armed raids" are keen on this mode. It's hard, but it's fun.

Armed raids Dayz Mod
In the mod of "armed raid 3", players need to choose their own airborne location by plane. After landing, they need to collect props and weapons. The range of survival will continue to narrow. The goal of players is to be the last survivor. At that time, the mod was spread in this not too big circle. It was favored by many players with the rules of intense stimulation, and also attracted the attention of Sony online entertainment (SOE).
SOE found Brandon, and they hope to add the same big escape game as Brandon's mod to their already launched multiplayer online survival game h1z1. Brandon said he would go as long as he could pay. In SOE, Brandon was hired as the technical consultant of the big escape mode, and spent several months in SOE. After the completion of the big escape mode, he went back to work on his mod. After the game went public, h1z1 surpassed many popular games of steam platform in just one week and became the sales champion at that time.

"Father of chicken" Brandon green
In fact, the reason why h1z1 can be popular has nothing to do with whether it is a survival game or not. Almost all the credit should be attributed to the big escape mode. Players are buying the game for this mode. In 2016, daybreak, the studio of SOE, took over the operation of the game and made a game out of the main body, which is the familiar h1z1: the king of killing.
Fortunately, at that time, when the game live broadcasting industry was just emerging, king of killing itself had a very high playability, and even watching others play it also had a very good program effect. The hosts all liked to choose this game to rub off a wave of enthusiasm. In this situation, king of killing really ushered in his peak. At the same time, the game At one time, the number of online players exceeded 100000, and the sales volume of the game quickly exceeded one million. With the help of the hosts, the number of players in the game is increasing day by day.

Initial game map
# external worries and internal troubles
There is a common phenomenon in the game circle, especially in the field of online games. If more people play a game, the environment of this game will become worse, especially in the Chinese market. The proliferation of players has not only increased the frequency of plug-ins, but also led many Chinese players to set up a red army in King of killing. As long as they meet in red, they are friends, and take the national curse as the "joint code". They ignore the matching mechanism of the game, attack other players in groups, and extremely destroy the game experience of other ordinary players, so that Xu Many foreign players are forced to wear red clothes and learn from national scolding. Overseas players complain that they have no experience in playing games. Daybreak, the operator, decides to take measures. Although the behavior of the "Red Army" has seriously damaged the fairness of the game and belongs to the category of malicious team formation, it is wordless that they have chosen the most extreme measure: blocking the IP in mainland China.

You should know that at that time, "king of killing" had a considerable player base from China, they were the main player group and the biggest consumer of the game, but daybreak directly blocked the Chinese IP and did not allow Chinese players to go online. What's more confusing is that Mingming has locked the Chinese IP, but the Chinese players can still buy the game, and the players who buy the game will not go to the game for some reason, on the other hand, it is enough to see that daybreak's operation concept of the game is not right. Soon after the IP was locked, Jedi survival appeared. Compared with king of killing, it has a better game picture and a more comprehensive game system. Therefore, players at home and abroad have turned to Jedi survival, and those who once set up the Red Army in King of killing and opened an external hook have taken the opportunity to harm Jedi survival.

The Jedi survive
Not to mention what happened in Jedi survival, the protagonist of our story is still the king of killing. This is its first cold. First, it cuts the largest group of its own, and then it is exploited by its competitors. What the king of killing has to do is to recover its market. In March last year, the game finally ended the EA preemptive experience stage and ushered in the official version. The king of killing also confirmed that it was renamed as h1z1: big escape.
At the same time, the game adopts the operation mode of free play, internal purchase and charging, and the ban on the mainland IP is lifted, making the number of game players break the new record again, but the following is that the poor evaluation of the game also breaks the new record, only one day, more than 2000 bad evaluations are received, and the content of the bad evaluation is nothing more than that the game changes from paying to free, and the external connection is still rampant, and the operators unlock the mainland IP And so on. But even if the number of players has picked up, at this time, "survival of the Jedi" can be said to have occupied half of the big escape game, "with a better, why play that laggard?" I believe most old players think so, and the failure of h1z1 is only a matter of time.

The updated publicity map is really attractive to the players who have not been exposed to it
End of       
In August last year, daybreak shut down the server of h1z1: survive and focused on the update of big escape, but it seems to have little effect. It seems that daybreak can't help the game for a while. In March this year, daybreak replaced the operation and development of the game to nantg studio, and the game was renamed as "Z1 big escape".
The new owner seems to find that the game can't be saved after trying to operate it, so only a month later, he returned the management right of the game to daybreak, and nantg went to develop a mobile game. At that time, the number of online players in the game was up to nearly 5000, while today, the number of daily players in the game is only 300, with a game supporting 150 people, while the existing players can make the game play three games at the same time, which is very bleak.

Data as of the date of writing
If daybreak had promised to keep updating and operating as long as there are players playing, but in the current situation, it seems that the game has no value worth updating and maintaining, far less direct than trying other projects. The biggest reason for the failure of "Z1 escape" lies in the operator's carelessness, the low level of rectification of the external problems, and the isolation of the largest group of players in the game in a one size fits all way. It is clear that he had the chance to become famous. If he could do these works well, he might not have the chance to succeed in "survival of the Jedi", and he would not go to the end of the world like today Step. Ironically, the producer of "the Jedi survives" was Braden green, the technical consultant of "king of killing", who killed his former partner.
