Speaking of the famous line "everything is empty and everything is allowed", we all know that it comes from the assassin's Creed. This line has been implemented from the early works of the series to today, and has always been the core values in the series of Assassin's Creed. The assassin's creed is so popular that I don't need to introduce it too much. No matter boys or girls, they can't forget the iconic hood and "leap of faith". Assassin's creed is not only a series of games, but also a kind of culture. It's a kind of spirit of fearless desire for freedom. Its influence is so great that the developer Ubisoft treats it as a son, and it's also a series with the most works under Ubisoft.

The success of Assassin's Creed series today is mainly due to its solid game quality, but few people know that the birth of Assassin's creed is due to a famous character of Ubisoft many years ago. He's a prince, but he doesn't like fishing, bird racing and barbecue; he's also as light as a swallow, but he can't touch the light of the white robe. The people gradually forget his appearance, but they will never forget his name. He is Prince of Persia.

The story about the prince dates back to a college student named Jordan McKenna in the 1980s. The aspiring young man has a strong interest in electronic computers since high school. From the age of 15, he has devoted all his spare time to the "Apple II" computer, and occasionally wrote a few small games when he was free. At the age of 20, in order to ease the economic situation of his family and himself, he decided to make a game with a commercial nature in exchange for living expenses. His first known work is karateka.

Karate game screen
This is a common horizontal action clearance game. The game's playing method is nothing more than to control a karate master to kill demons and eliminate demons and defeat demons to save the princess. However, due to the detailed and smooth character action performance in the game, it has attracted many people's attention. With the help of the publisher Broderbund, the game became the best-selling Apple II computer platform at that time One of the game works, with a sales volume of 500000 copies, also made McKenna the first pot of gold in his life. In view of the success of karate, Broderbund, the publisher, also took a fancy to the young man's technical ability, so he had the idea of bringing it into his hands to produce a new work, which was also welcomed by McKenna. But what kind of game to make this time is not up to him. The developer only gave him a few pieces of information, and the story background had to be Arabic style The main character is Baghdad (Persian "God's gift").

McKenna's strength lies in the meticulous production of characters' movements. This time, he wanted to go further on the original basis, so he adopted the shooting method of "transfer tracing machine", which was quite popular in the animation industry at that time. You can understand that this is the earliest motion capture technology. Its principle is to use the camera to capture the actor's actions, and then the animator will describe the characters' actions frame by frame to form an animation, and then scan the animation into the program. The advantage is that the action of the characters in the game can be as smooth as the movie, and the fluency of the new work of McKenna in the game industry at that time can't be matched. And the game itself is also a horizontal action clearance game. The plot of the game is deeper and more complex than karate, but the same is the classic formula of hero saving beauty. The protagonist has also changed from karate master to the young prince of Persia (although the thief pretends to be the Prince), so just like the previous one, the game is directly called Prince of Persia.

After all, the game adopted the concept of leading industry at that time, so the development cycle of the game is also getting longer and longer. After all, it took four years to complete the game and it went public in 1989. With the fame of the previous work, the work also attracted the attention of many players before it was released. With excellent quality and interesting level, it quickly became a hit. It logged into about seven different platforms at that time and successfully achieved 2 million sales. With such achievements, the sequel has become a sure thing. Prince of Persia 2: Shadow and flame was released in 1993. It continues the story of the previous work, but also greatly strengthens the screen again. The overall game flow is several times of that of the previous work. Unfortunately, this work does not reproduce the glory of the previous work. The sales volume is slightly lower than that of the previous generation, but it is still a good quality one Masterpiece.

However, McKenna's brilliant career has not been sustained. With the passage of time, the game has also come to the 3D era from the 2D era. For a long time, almost all the world is doing 3D games, whether real 3D or Pseudo 3D, as long as it is 3D. Players who have played the game for a certain period of time should not be unfamiliar with the Tomb Raider in the early years. Laura Crawford, the protagonist in the game, can make all kinds of magnificent and practical climbing, rolling, jumping and other actions to cross all kinds of dangerous situations. The excellent level design and new 3D playing methods make this sexy female Explorer a hot big one in the circle and out of the circle in an instant The main reason for the characters is that there were almost no female protagonists at that time, and Laura was undoubtedly the most successful one.

This can make the prince of the other country suffer. Since I have 3D, I also have 3D, so Prince of Persia 3D came into being. This work can be said to be the biggest one invested by the developer Broderbund. After all, making 3D at that time was almost equal to burning money. If the game is not well bought, it may directly lead to the company's violent death. However, the consistent smooth action of Prince of Persia series has not been shown again in the full 3D picture. The overall playing method of the game is almost the same as that of Tomb Raider. The biggest difference is that the protagonist uses a knife rather than a gun.
Because it's the first attempt, there are many problems in game optimization and bug, so the experience of the game is a little bit bad. Fortunately, the game is still interesting from an objective point of view. It's not a good work, but it's not a dung work. After the baptism of Tomb Raider, most of the players' feelings about the game are "lack of sincerity", "changing skin" "Game" and so on, so the sales volume of the game is certainly huge, and the stock price of the learning company, the parent company of the publisher Broderbund, has also been falling all the way, almost reaching the level of being unable to make ends meet.

Prince of Persia 3D game screen
Helpless, the company is worth selling IP everywhere to find a thigh hug, or it will really go bankrupt. In this environment, it is no longer necessary for McKenna to stay in the company, so he left the company and chose to engage in film production. In such a situation, Prince of Persia is valued by Ubisoft from France. It plans to take this IP first. Naturally, the learning company readily agrees, "give it as long as you pay.". In this way, the distribution right of Prince of Persia has been handed over to Ubisoft, but they have no right to make games even though they have IP. The reason is that half of the IP copyright of Prince of Persia is in the hands of the original author, michina. If they want to make games, they have to nod their heads.

Taking advantage of this IP and to express sincerity, Ubisoft team first made a demo for Prince of Persia. In this demo, the Prince changed the slow and slow action in the previous 3D version, and mastered the local "local specialty" Parkour ability. No matter running, jumping, rolling and climbing, it has unprecedented consistency and fluency, which perfectly solved the previous work All the problems that have occurred. Obviously, the team who made this demo is a real fan of this series. With this demo Ubisoft, he found McKenna. McKenna said, "this is the effect he has always wanted to create." so he accepted Ubisoft's authorization request and was willing to participate in the development of the game together to ensure the "original" of the work.
#  sacrifice to the prince and become an assassin
Ubisoft has broken its heart for this new work to express its love for this series. It has a new 3D engine, a seamless map, a smooth character movement and a "blade of time" system that can trace back time. In 2003, the series restart work "Prince of Persia: sand of time" appeared in the players' field of vision. Relying on those novel settings and performances mentioned above, it has once again earned the players' attention, making many old players who initially did not look forward to the series again full of hope. The final performance of the game is also true. The final sales volume of the whole platform of the game reached 14 million sets. As of 2005, there were 2 million sets of sales, which not only reappeared the glory of Prince of Persia, but also directly surpassed the former. The players can't help but sigh: "prince he is alive!" And Ubisoft itself also relies on the success of this work to change from a first-class game studio to a 3A game developer.

Prince of Persia: sand of time
In the following two years, Ubisoft successively launched Prince of Persia 2: the heart of the warrior and Prince of Persia 3: the king is matchless, which is regarded as a trilogy after a series of resurrection. Among them, the king is matchless is a masterpiece of a series. The newly added assassination system also corrects the overall rhythm of the game, which provides a stage for the whole "sand of time" trilogy Perfect period, considering that the development cycle of each work is only one year, this undoubtedly makes Ubisoft earn a lot of money. And how can such a golden IP be put in such a white place? They also began to plan the next series of development of Prince of Persia. They plan to restart the series twice, and at the same time, they hope to present the story of Prince of Persia in a different perspective. In this perspective, Ubisoft plans to put it on the assassin who protects the prince. So Prince of Persia: Assassin begins to enter the development stage, and the open world Prince of Persia, which focuses on the next generation of mainframe at the same time, is also put on the agenda.

Prince of Persia 3: the king is unparalleled
As a result, Ubisoft found that they wanted to add more and more elements to the book Prince of Persia: assassin and build a larger world outlook, so they made a very risky decision: to separate this work from the frame of Prince of Persia as an individual series, to abandon the setting of Prince of Persia and start a new system Do. So in 2007, the derivative game "Assassin's Creed", which was made by yubidang as a water trial work, went on sale. Meanwhile, the new prince of Persia is still in the process of production. But it never occurred to me that this water trial product, because of its cool and cool game style and more popular settings, made the game more popular than ever. It set a sales record of Ubisoft for many years, and sold 10 million copies in one year, faster than any previous product of Ubisoft. This sudden success also caught Ubisoft by surprise.

Assassin's Creed
# end
A year later, the new prince of Persia (also known as Prince of Persia 4), whose painting style changed greatly, sold well, but it was still dwarfed by the sales volume of 10 million set by the assassin's Creed. The obvious sales comparison also made Ubisoft realize the difference between the two. It seems that the era of Prince of Persia has passed. After all, they invested a lot of manpower and material resources in Prince of Persia, but it is far less direct than a new IP. Obviously, the status of Assassin's Creed surpassed Prince of Persia in an instant, as if they had already There is no reason to make a new book for Prince of Persia. In order to give the fans an account, in 2010 Ubisoft launched the last "Prince of Persia" work "the sand of forgetting", which is the end of the series.

Prince of Persia
At the beginning of 2013, Ubisoft officially announced to suspend the follow-up production of Prince of Persia series works, and when to come up with ideas suitable for the new works before considering the development. It has been more than six years since now, and even cell division, which has been sealed for many years, has confirmed that it is about to launch a sequel. However, the fans' voice for the new work Prince of Persia is so high that no news of the new work flows out. In my opinion, in fact, we can be optimistic. After all, we can't say too much. Maybe when the time is right, Ubisoft will try again.
