When it comes to the most popular fighting games nowadays, it's not "Nintendo star fighting". On November 7, the NS platform "Nintendo star fighting special edition" broke the record set by all fighting games with 15.7 million sales, becoming the best-selling fighting game in history. At the same time, the "fighting" also released its latest DLC characters: from SNK classic fighting games Terry, the popular character in the legend of the hungry wolf. Terry not only has a very high degree of reduction or even better character modeling, and even all of its representative moves are also included, but it is worth mentioning that the character also retains the original instructions in the arcade game in terms of operation. Although this operation mode is different from the previous operation mode of "big fight", it has the characteristics of arcade operation.

Terry's role not only appeared in the legend of hungry wolves, but also in the classic fighting game boxer. In the early years, SNK, the developer of these games, was a major representative of arcade games. In that era when arcade games were popular in the world, not everyone wanted to go to the noisy Arcade hall to play games, and a considerable number of players preferred it Huan playing games at home, not only can have a quieter environment, but also can practice operation at will without any scruples.

At that time, if you want to play arcade fighting games at home, such as "Street Fighter" and "real fight", you only need to buy a Nintendo SFC and bring a game with you. If you want to play SNK games such as "Boxer" and "soul service", only its official NEOGEO host is the best experience choice. The author is lucky to get the qualification to experience SNK's latest NEOGEO arcade stick pro (ASP for short). The following is a comprehensive evaluation of this latest product.

# hardware specifications
![The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation](89e42482119c43dfa7109d15e167dd6e.jpg)
There are not many packing accessories, including a host body, a power cord, a adapter for USB to type-C, four anti-skid pads that can be pasted to the bottom of the host, a neo logo sticker and a manual (but there are two for some reason).

The front of the host is printed with the logo of NEOGEO. According to the current information, it seems that this ASP host only has a white version, with the specification of 428.9  214.2  124mm. It is about the same size as a standard keyboard, but it is much more prominent in height. The host weighs 2.56kg, which is not much worse than a real game host. It can be said that it is full of weight. If it is placed on the desktop, it will have a very heavy feeling, which can also meet the habit of some players like to play with the rocker on their legs. The overall shape of the host seems to pay homage to the NEOGEO CD handle produced by SNK in the early stage, but it is much larger than the handle, and its color matching and the font sprayed on the body are consistent with the CD handle.

The front end of the host is equipped with two type-C interfaces for external connection of additional NEOGEO handle and a 3.5mm headphone hole, while the back end is equipped with a type-C input interface for connection of power cable, an HDMI interface for output image and a USB interface. The maximum output resolution of the host mode is 720p, and USB can be used to update the host system with external devices and control peripherals with other USB ports.

There are four function buttons and two mode switch on the right side of the host, which are designed to avoid accidental contact during use. From left to right, there are consecutive keys, option keys, and more common selection keys and start keys on the game handle. The two mode switches are mode switch (○ rocker mode / ● host mode), and applicable platform switch to prevent conflict when multiple devices are connected to the same terminal.

There is a connecting line at the bottom of the left side of the host used to connect the host as a controller with other terminals. The connecting line is directly stored in the host body and cannot be removed directly. The hole position on the cover of the storage box can easily lead out the line without worrying about the problem of the line being pinched. At the same time, the cover of the storage box is thick and firm. As long as it is not too hard, it should not be easy to get out There is damage. The connecting line is two meters long, which belongs to the standard specification of general wired peripherals. However, because it is located on the left side of the host, some people may not adapt to it.

In terms of rocker, the ball head adopts a polished ball head with the same specification as the streetcar. When controlling the rocker, you can intuitively feel the square gear in four directions and the crisp four small directions. When using, you can easily feel the direction of the rocker and the input of instructions. A ball head replacement auxiliary hole is attached on the back of the host and just below the rocker. Players can use the tool to easily remove the rocker and screw off the ball head for replacement.

The common eight key layout is adopted on the surface of the host computer. The game under SNK basically only needs four keys to operate, and the eight key layout can adapt to more games and games such as street fighter, which can use eight keys. The key program of the key belongs to medium, and the key is soft compared with the specifications of the arcade, so it doesn't need too much force to respond to the key, but the key layout of the eight key is not compact, and the player with small hands may feel that he can't press it too much when operating, so he needs to adjust his habitual key layout in advance before the game starts. It is worth mentioning that the surface of the host computer and all buttons are made of fine matte material, so players can not worry about the sweaty palms that will cause the operation panel surface to become oily and slippery and affect the feel.

Although ASP is an integrated device of host and rocker, it should have built-in 20 original SNK classic arcade games, but for some reasons,  the ASP host of Guohang version does not include built-in game  , only one electronic manual can be read after connecting TV in host mode, and there is no other function. This does not exclude that in the future, the official will lift the ban or update the game in some ways,   the specific information should be subject to the official information  . It is also worth mentioning that in the host mode, if you want to connect the TV or monitor, you need to provide your own HDMI cable.

20 original games that should have been included
To sum up, at present, we can only use the rocker mode temporarily. When it is used in the rocker mode, its operation principle is basically the same as the general game controller peripherals, and it can adapt to all game types and platforms that support the controller control, and it will be automatically adapted to Xbox 360. At present, several popular arcade simulators, ASP, can directly adapt to the network, but it requires players to use ASP to change the key mapping in the simulator settings. For some simulators that can't adapt to the Xbox 360 handle, some keys may not be mapped. At this time, players need to switch the ASP mode by pressing the options key on the side of the host, so that they can be used normally even in older simulators. At the same time, by connecting the attached adapter, the USB connector can be converted into type-C interface, and the mobile device with type-C interface can also be connected, and it can also be applied to the simulator of mobile terminal.

Simple setup of WinKawaks simulator
Due to the limitation of platform hardware, ASP can not be directly connected to the home host (PS, NS, etc.) as a peripheral at present, so it needs to be connected through a special converter. In the PC version of the game, most of the fighting games will support the original direct connection adaptation (iron fist, boxer, street bully, etc.), after all, these games themselves support the use of rockers for control.

Easy adaptation to boxer 14
If ASP is used in other third-party games of non combat games, most of the Games will automatically adapt it to Xbox 360 handle. Although it can be controlled, most of the games that support handle operation do not have the settings to change the key layout. Therefore, the author suggests that if ASP is used to play other games, it is better to play the horizontal action games with relatively simple system , and other types of game control can make you miserable and suspicious.
    concluding remarks  
At present, NEOGEO arcade Stick Pro is accepting the agreement, and the price of Bank of China 899 is the lowest in the world. If it is only used as a rocker peripheral, it also belongs to a mid-range price, with strong adaptability, it is worth recommending. Online circulation can be achieved through the use of external forces to lift the ban on the built-in games of the host, but the author does not advocate this kind of behavior very much. After cracking, the machine will lose the right of three guarantees. If there is a problem with the machine, it will be more difficult to deal with it.

In a blink of an eye, NEOGEO has been born for nearly 28 years, but until now, we still don't forget the well-known role images in "Boxer" and "soul service". Nintendo even included them in "big fight". It can be seen that its position in the field of games is high. If we can't forget the time when we were young when we were burning our youth in the arcade hall, It is a good choice to keep it as a treasure.
