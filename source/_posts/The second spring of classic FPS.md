If you want to ask what kind of game is the most popular at present, it is undoubtedly a multi player competitive game. No matter MoBa or shooting, it has a high enthusiasm. If it is not because "fighting with people has endless fun", it must be because "solo music is not as good as all music". Among them, shooting game, as the "gun" in "gun car ball", is still a major force of video games until now. Among all the most popular game types, shooting game is the most senior one. This series has experienced nearly 26 years, during which there have been no several evolutions and innovations, and now it has been divided into various styles.

In the early years, FPS focused on simple and direct game experience. It only needed to shoot all the enemies rushing to you on the screen. There was no plot depth, and it didn't need to care about the background setting. In short, it just needed to pull the trigger. Due to the retro thinking, we now call this kind of game classic FPS. This type of work is still being launched, but it is not as brilliant as it used to be. However, from the recent momentum, it seems that classic FPS has found a chance to return.

#  "old" thinking
From the end of last century to the beginning of this century, it is not only the golden period of video games, but also the most confused period. During this period, a variety of works with revolutionary nature and industry benchmark level were born. Due to the gradual popularity of home hosts and computers, video games have gradually become a very popular form of entertainment. Therefore, the competition in the game market has become fierce. Some people can be regarded as conservatives, while others can be regarded as innovators. The former tends to refer to successful cases to ensure a stable quality of the game, while the latter always wants to explore new and more distinctive game elements. In the early years, the classic FPS was the most popular FPS game at that time because of the leading role of id software's "destroyer" series, the simple and happy game playing method and the fast-paced multiplayer combat mode. With "destroyer" as a pioneer, there are many other manufacturers who want to take a share. Among them, 3D reals, as a representative, has created classic FPS works such as "destroyer" and "Shadow Warrior".

Destroy the Duke
These retro FPS have one thing in common, or this is the cultural trend at that time. They all have certain restriction level elements, such as beautifying violence and bloody content, and adding some black humor elements, which is the same as the popular r-level and B-level films at that time. Then, due to the appearance of half life produced by valve, it is possible to add script narrative setting in FPS games. At the same time, the emergence of mod in anti terrorist elite will lead FPs to a new height in multiplayer combat, which leads to the emergence of FPS with half life as the watershed, and FPS games with moderate game rhythm and immersion FPS games with emphasis on narrative The former retro FPS has suddenly declined in popularity, so if the classical FPS wants to survive, it also needs to be reformed and upgraded to some extent. With the improvement of game development technology, the use of full 3D pictures with better performance and real-time calculation with better performance gradually become the mainstream, which may be the key to the breakthrough of classical FPS.

Half a life
The characteristics of classic FPs are as mentioned above. The plot is relatively weak, and there is no too complex game mechanism. Players can use a variety of cool big killers to kill the enemy to the ground. Most of the works have no design even for the setting of "reload ammunition". What players need to do is to avoid the enemy's attack, aim at the enemy and pull the trigger. This kind of design is not only used in the single machine works of retro FPS, but also in the mode of multi person battle. For example, hammer of thunder and unreal arena adopt this style. Players need to let their attacks hit the enemy as much as possible when they are moving at high speed, so as to generate a game mode called "arena FPS". If the classical FPS wants to keep pace with the times, it may be a good idea to add some popular and common elements to the existing framework.

Hammer of thunder 2
     try   
The first successful classic FPS game in the next generation is called "hero Sam", which is a name that many players will not be unfamiliar with. The main players of this series use their own power to kill enemies of different types and surges in the open scene with various weapons. In 2001, it was rare to realize a game like "hero Sam" with gorgeous scenes and excellent pictures on the PC platform. The combination of exotic customs and alien monsters also formed a magical chemical reaction. Monsters and weapons are various, the style of the scene is open and changeable, and the colored egg elements are everywhere, except that the game needs to consume a lot of time in the later stage, There is almost nothing wrong with this work. However, some people may not believe that the all 3dfps, such as hero Sam, is an independent game.

Hero Sam: second encounter
On the other hand, in addition to hero Sam launching multiple sequels as a representative of classic FPS games, many classic old IPS are also constantly trying to break through, such as id software's "destroyer", "German headquarters" and "Thunderbolt hammer" are always trying to add new elements to the game to provide different game experience, but the final effect is all It's not particularly good. For example, "destroyer 3" and "back to German headquarters" began to try to imitate "half life" to enrich the game plot and introduce the elements of terror, "hammer of thunderbolt" directly abandoned the single player mode and focused on multi player combat. Obviously, the attempt of id software in the first few years did not succeed. The next door "Duke of destruction" launched a sequel "Duke of eternal destruction" after 13 years of ticket skipping, although it was poorly evaluated, it was quite interesting. After many years, shadow warrior ushered in a restart, winning the recognition of the players with its excellent painting and excellent fighting experience.

Restart version of Shadow Warrior
After that, ID realized his own problems, and let many of his works return to the original game style and enlarge its characteristics. The brand-new rebooted "destroyer" and the brand-new style "German army headquarters" have gained good reputation, and have become the two top brands of Bethesda's dealers. Meanwhile, he has also made a comparison with the introduction of "fury" with the theme of wasteland Ideal results. In contrast, the frequency of other manufacturers' works is much less, but the related works in the field of independent games are very common. There are a series of "killing space" that emphasizes the online cooperation of multiple people, and there are many "dusk" and "ion Maiden" that tend to restore the ancient pictures together, because the ancient pictures and development concept are very important for The technical requirements are not high, so if there are independent gamers who want to do FPS, the classical type will be the first choice.

    concluding remarks  
To a large extent, the reason why the classic FPS game can survive to now is not that the arena FPS like "hammer of thunderbolt" has been almost eliminated by the market. On the one hand, it is due to the combination of old IP and new elements by large manufacturers, on the other hand, it is due to the continuous love of independent gamers. FPS is a small circle, which can interact with each other without interference or easily. At least from the current market, although the classical FPS has received a cold shoulder, the developers do not want to abandon its idea, such as the new "destroyer: Forever", "fury 2", and even "no land 3" are constantly trying to integrate into the new yuan It's a good thing that we keep our vitality. After all, FPS games on the market are homogenized seriously. It's a wise choice to stick to our own characteristics.
