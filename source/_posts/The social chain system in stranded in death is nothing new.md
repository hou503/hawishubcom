Recently, the game circle has entered the off-season when the game lineup is relatively scarce. There are only one or two major works that can attract the attention of the players. Some players may be busy incubating their desired Baoke dream at this time, and some players are sending them over the mountains. "Stranded in death" is undoubtedly the most controversial 3A level game this year. No one likes it. People who like it can't help themselves. People who don't like it may not stick to it at the beginning of the game.

When death ran aground first announced the core playing methods of the game to the public, the game producer Xiufu Oshima strongly publicized the game mechanism of the game, which he called himself "social chain system". Although players can't see other players in the game, they can see traces left by other players in the game, such as road signs, props and vehicles And to help players, so that players even in a single game, there will be a sense of connection with players around the world at all times. In fact, the so-called "social chain" system is not created by the island, but "stranded in death" is undoubtedly the best work to show this mechanism.
The origin of      
The concept of game has appeared immediately since people have the sense of entertainment, and the original game has no too complex rules, such as all kinds of popular chess and card games, in essence, they are all turn games, all of them are one person performing their own steps and then suddenly changing to the next person. The biggest limitation of these games is that it must be played face to face by several people. It is inevitable that even if two friends are in a foreign country, they want to come to the last game. Therefore, some people begin to think about how to make two people play the last game even if they are not together. At that time, when there was no Internet, someone thought of sending the board by post, drawing the board and board on a piece of paper, indicating their own execution steps, and then sending the paper to another player who participated in the game, while another person also sent the paper back in the same way, so that the game would be completed again and again, and as for how long the game would take See if the postman is going fast.

First, there is the mail chess, and then other chess and cards are added to it. Later, even some large-scale board games have launched the mail version, which is very popular. Even there are many companies and media specializing in the mail game, and some companies are still operating today.
Later, with the gradual popularization of home computers and the development of the Internet, even video games have entered the information age. E-mail has become a more efficient online way to replace the traditional mail based games. Undoubtedly, e-mail is much faster than ordinary letters. Therefore, a new mechanism of online confrontation game has been derived. It is a classic game created by micro prose Strategy game "X-Com" and "heroes of Magic 3" produced by 3Do use e-mail online, and their online way is to send the game's archive to the opponent player after the player completes a round of execution, and then send the archive back after the other player takes over the archive. Although it's much faster, it's essentially the same as the traditional postal way of thinking.

    nostalgia  
Later, the multiplayer online game has developed into a familiar pattern. Players can interact with each other without delay, while the slow-paced online game mode of mailing is no longer favored by developers. If you look at it from the current perspective, the mail game is undoubtedly very slow and troublesome, both time-consuming and laborious, but there is a unique romantic atmosphere that only old games can have.
The "social chain" system used in "stranding to death" is called "asynchronous online" in the development field, and mail game is the design prototype of asynchronous online, which aims to generate interaction even if the player is not in the same time and the same area, sometimes when the player is not online, other players can also interact with it, to a greater extent, asynchronous online design Inspired by games that used e-mail online in the early years, the current friend systems of all kinds of mobile games are the same. Even if the player is not online, you can pick up a character or a resource from your friend.

Large facilities can also be built by multiple players
With the mail game gradually fading out of the players' vision, asynchronous online has more often changed from the "core" of a game to a "mechanism" in the game. Although it will not appear as the core of the game, it can also make the game more interesting. Initially, this setting often appears in many racing games, and the players' racing records will be "ghost" The form of "car" appears directly on the track, and later in many pseudo real style racing games, players can actively download other players' ghost cars to learn the operation of other players and challenge their records, etc.
For the vast majority of players, the concept of "asynchronous online" may come into contact for the first time in the game, mostly from the "soul of darkness" series and "blood source" produced by from software. No matter which series, players can leave notes at specific points, and other players can see it after passing here. Some of these notes are good intentions Show, and there are malicious jokes, and even can see other players died in situ left traces and projections.

The marks on the ground can attract friendly players or hostile players
To a large extent, perhaps these asynchronous online settings in the "soul" series are the nostalgia of developers Miyazaki YingGAO for the once mail based game. After all, there are not many people who know the name at present. With the foresight of the "soul" series, it also provides inspiration for many later works: as RenWang, which is also a "black soul like" game, is more biased and "brush", so there are many ways to obtain equipment in the game, in which players can also see the traces left by other players after death, but players can not only see, but also play other games The players who are recruited are not the players themselves, but the "crazy corpses" controlled by the computer. They wear the same equipment as the original players, and have a chance to get one of them after killing. Because the equipment of other players is usually excellent, they also give the players the motivation to fight with them, which is one of the core playing methods of the game Ring.

    concluding remarks  
I vaguely remember watching a movie called "the fast Racer" a long time ago. The protagonist began to compete with others in a race. The fastest record holder of this race track was the protagonist's brother, but unfortunately he was no longer there. The race was so superb that he was about to break his brother's record, but he finally let go of the gas before rushing to the end I kept my brother's fastest record. Then I heard a similar story many years ago, but the protagonist was a little brother who lost his father when he was young, and he saw his father's racing ghost car in the dusty game machine. The little brother also stepped on the brake before he was about to surpass his father to retain his father's ghost car, because if he won, the record would no longer exist.

Stills of "the fast Racer"
This is a concept worth remembering and remembering. It is also an indispensable part of the development of video games. In his own game, Hideki Oshima has changed its mechanism back to the core again. Without this function, the experience of the game will be greatly reduced. Although this person is a little high-profile, his talent is undeniably outstanding. Asynchronous online makes the world see new possibilities again. Maybe in the near future, there will be more new types of multiplayer games.
