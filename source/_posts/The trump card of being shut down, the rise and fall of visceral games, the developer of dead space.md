On October 18, 2017, a studio named visceral game was closed. It's no surprise that the game studio was closed in the game circle. But if the company that closed it is the EA known as "studio killer", the event itself will be added with a layer of debuff with the effect of "ridicule", which will not only attract the players' anger and abuse At the same time, we will be more sorry for this unfortunate studio. If this studio can be opened to the present, it should have a history of 21 years. You may not think of any works of this name alone, but when it comes to the dead space series, you may have a big idea.

When it comes to "dead space", until this is a third person shooting horror game, many players can't help shivering just watching the bloody and dark scenes and strange looking monsters in the screenshots of the game. There is such a thing between players that can reach a consensus: if the protagonist of the horror game is equipped with weapons, the horror level of the game will be reduced to a lot, or even to almost none, but the "dead space" with shooting as the core method of play has not been reduced in the construction of the horror atmosphere, which is enough to prove its quality is excellent, and the more people think it is excellent Xiu, more and more people feel sorry for its absence.

Visceral Games was founded in 1998. It was originally called "Redwood Shores" because it is located in the Redwood City of San Francisco Bay area, California. For some reason, the unknown small studio attracted the attention of EA, which is also located in Redwood City. Nick earl, former senior vice president of EA, proposed to the senior management that they should buy the studio. The reason for this is that the two founders of the studio, Michael kantley and Glenn Scofield, have a different temperament ã€‚ This kind of metaphysical reason can't be accepted by any Chinese. After all, the acquisition is not a trivial matter. After all, Nick's position is here. At the same time, he is constantly encouraging. EA finally can't help but agree to Nick's request, and the studio is renamed "EA Redwood sea shore studio".

Glenn Scofield on the left and Michael kantley on the right
It turns out that Nick's vision is right. In the next eight years after joining EA in 2001, mahogany coast was mainly responsible for the production of EA's IP adaptation games, such as 007 series, godfather series and Lord of the rings series. They were responsible for a total of 10 works. From an objective point of view, although the quality of these games can not be said to be excellent, they can definitely meet the expectations of film fans, especially the godfather series and the original film even form a complementary relationship. It can be said that EA with the mahogany coast has created a golden age of "film and game linkage" in the field of video games.

In the 2003 game "007: who is competing with the front", the recovery degree of the character appearance is very high

As two ideal game producers, it's definitely not Michael and Glen's life to adapt the game according to their boss's requirements all day long, which makes them have the intention to leave EA. Meanwhile, the next door movietv has long been interested in their ability in making games and plans to incorporate them. EA has no way. In order to retain them, it gave Redwood coast a chance to make its own original IP, which left them. According to media interviews, they were deeply influenced by the immersive RPG game "cyber Wizard" and were overwhelmed by the game atmosphere they created. At the same time, in 2004, they came into contact with the survival horror game "biochemical crisis 4", which once reached the peak level. So they had the idea of combining the map design of "cyber Wizard" with the play method of survival terrorist shooting of "biochemical crisis 4". In view of the great success of biochemical crisis 4 at that time, EA also affirmed their proposal and was willing to provide more resources for it.

Now looking back, death space has learned a lot from biochemical crisis 4
This game is the first generation of "dead space" released in October 2008. No one could have imagined that the game had an unprecedented success. At the end of that year, it had a sales volume of 1 million sets, while the cumulative sales volume reached 4 million sets. As a brand-new original IP, this achievement can be said to be quite successful, which is partly due to the reputation of EA as a leading manufacturer The big reason is that the quality of the game is really excellent, and the media and players also give wide recognition to this work. Glenn and Michael's position in the company leaped, with the noisy capital of mahogany coast, becoming the independent studio of EA directly, and also renamed as the visual games (VG for short). It is the great success of "dead space" series that has laid the main tone of the future of the studio: darkness, terror, blood and adulthood.

It's depressing just to see
# the sword moves on one side
However, despite the success of death space, Glenn and Michael chose to leave, joined Activision and set up hammer studio to do cod. I don't know what they think. EA finally gave them the right to create freely, but they chose to give up, and running to Activision didn't get the freedom they wanted. Cod: advanced war and cod: World War II, which were produced by them, didn't get much public praise, but fortunately, the sales volume of the game was still considerable, which made them finally sit on activism The location of the layer. Looking back at VG, after the two creators left, the sequel of "dead space" must be done, but at the same time, they have to be busy living their new IP, and "Dante hell" is their answer.

Modern war 3 was produced by sledgehammer studio
Strictly speaking, "Dante hell" is an action game with good quality, but the only disadvantage is that it is too much like the God of war. No matter the overall style or the combat system, or even the fight against the huge boss with mortal body, it is similar to "the God of war". I don't think it's the God of war that made an extra chapter. The average sales volume of Dante hell is obviously not enough for EA. VG realized at this time that it's better to be honest and give a sequel to dead space. EA still gives VG's support at all levels without elders, hoping that they can create a miracle again.

How similar are the colors of the game
"Dead space 2" was released in early 2011. Sure enough, the sales volume of the game was basically the same as that of the previous one, which is a matter of celebration, but in fact it is not. EA gave great hope to the sequel of "dead space", provided a lot of resources for it, even in the promotion of the game, although the game sold well, the profit actually earned was far lower than EA's plan, which disappointed EA. It's true that the game itself has no problems, but EA's own high expectations for dead space 2.

Although the second generation of the series is well known, not many people dare to try
In order to further improve the sales volume, the new work of VG plan "dead space" can adopt an open world system that is more in line with the trend of the times, and join the multi person online mode. However, for the horror game, the open world is the big taboo in the big taboo, and for the creation of the horror atmosphere, it is a devastating injury. Although the multi person online can increase the gameplay, after all, "death" Dead space has always been a single action adventure game with heavy atmosphere. The immersion of multiplayer game is definitely not as good as that of single player experience. It can be said that this time VG dug its own grave. "Dead space 3" was released in 2013. I believe that many old players have lost their desire to buy when they heard that the new work has been changed into an open world, and the final sales volume of the game is only half of that of the previous one. Such a large investment will eventually bring such a small return. In other words, everyone will be crazy, let alone EA, which has always attached great importance to benefits.

The three generations pay more attention to fighting content, just like biochemical crisis 6, which is no longer horrible
#  end: how can I get the word "miserable"?  
In short, the failure of VG is a combination of many factors. The departure of the elders has led to a great loss of vitality, a decline in the production level of original IP, and high expectations of EA. Although EA is known as the "studio killer", this pot can't be carried by EA alone. After all, EA has given VG too much support and expectations, and they even asked for "battlefield" from dice It's for VG, but VG hasn't done FPS games in his life, let alone battlefield, which is a pillar IP. The final outcome of the game is predictable.

Most unlike battlefield, battlefield: hard battle is their work
It may be that the pressure on VG is so heavy that VG can't breathe and can't respond to EA's high expectations. Of course, when a studio is at its best, there is no need to exist. Players regret the closure of VG, but after all, the main purpose of the game is to make money, and hope that players can understand it. EA will hide "dead space" as an IP, but never said that it will never launch a new work from now on. I hope I can hear the new news of "dead space" again in my lifetime.
