There are many kinds of video games, but the most popular ones are always those. Since ancient times, foreign countries can't get rid of the car ball without shooting, and domestic can't get rid of the immortal, the hero and the devil. No matter which kind of games are mainly based on confrontation or fighting, the game rhythm is faster and the playing method is more intense. Only a small number of people are not very interested in these "intense" activities. They prefer to experience a little relaxed and comfortable feeling in the game, such as being a mayor to manage urban planning, or being a chef to manage a restaurant. These games, which have both leisure and depth, and play more freehand, are usually called "pension Games".
When it comes to this name, many people will think of a game in an instant. It may be called "European truck simulation" or "star dew Valley story". The main purpose of these works is to experience the feeling of returning to nature in the game. In many works, the most popular one is the "simulation farm" series.

# the most popular hard core game
"Farming Simulator" is a series of simulation business Games launched by giants software in 20087. So far, it has launched 11 works, and the studio has gone through 11 years at the same time. At first, the company was only four people, but now the number has doubled 200 times, becoming one of the most successful game developers in Europe. When it comes to agricultural simulation management games, it is estimated that the first thought of most people should be the process of carrying a hoe and a bucket, running to the field to cultivate and sow a little, and taking good care of them to get the harvest.
In fact, in most people's impression, farming is exactly like this. Because of the primitive way, it can be used in many game works that are not the main farming work, such as all kinds of survival or open world works. But in "simulation farm", it is a real modern heavy machinery agriculture, revealing a "hard core" breath from the bone. The playing method of the game is to personally control these "giants" step by step to complete the process of farming. During this period, the players should not only master the methods of planting and management, but also focus on how to smoothly control these large machines.

Take the simplest plowing as an example. Players need to first sit in their own tractors and control the tractors to connect with the moldboard plows, then drive the tractors to pull the plows to cultivate in the fields, and the driving steps of the tractors are absolutely realistic style, which can not be said to be difficult but very tedious.
Almost most of the work is done in this way. During this period, players need to change different tools for tractors according to different steps. After all the planting work is completed, they are also responsible for loading, transportation and trading in person. It can be said that it completely restores a real working process of modern European farmers. Some people will think that they are tired enough to work and earn money. Who will have the heart to work hard in the game? Of course, there are people, and there are not a few. So far, 11 works of the simulation farm series have reached a sales volume of 10 million. The latest work "simulation farm 19" launched at the end of last year has sold 1 million copies in ten days, and about 15000 people are online on the same day when it was launched, pushing a number of 3A works to the top of the game sales list.

#Some people just love farming
As we all know, simulation games always have only a small number of audience groups because of their hard core playing methods, such as the military simulation game "armed raids" and the simulation car "magic KOSHA", which are more difficult to start with. Most people prefer simple and direct playing methods and get the most intuitive fun. So why is the "simulated farm" series so popular, and the sales of each generation are increasing? In fact, according to the statistics of developers giants software, nearly a quarter of their loyal fans are not "players" in the traditional sense. They are really engaged in agricultural related work in reality, and nearly half of them are "full-time farmers" in the real sense, which goes back to the one above The question is, why do these people play a farming game when they are farmers?

The main reason why these people choose this game is that they can learn from the experience of how to run a farm, as well as access to the equipment and environment that may be far away from reality. Nick Wilke is a farmer of Welker frame Inc., a 10000 acre wheat farm in Montana. His hobby in his spare time is to play simulation farm. Wilke said that in "simulation farm", he can enjoy a sense of achievement higher than running a farm in reality, and the simulation degree and details of "simulation farm" are more detailed than other similar works, such as the cost of farming will rise, and the price will fluctuate from time to time. If he can master these changes skillfully in the game, So it's also helpful to run a real farm. It is worth mentioning that Wilke's farm is also added to the game in the original proportion.

The development team can not only share their design concept and outlook for the new content, but also those professional "farmers" who are able to farm themselves in reality Experience and experience tell developers as the inspiration source of game design, such as the driving feel of a brand's vehicle, crop growth habits in different regions, can become the design details in the process of game design.
In addition to the exchange meeting, GS also held the competition of "simulation farm" in recent years. Last year's main project was haystack, while this year's project is 3v3, which collects wheat with a bonus of 100000 euros. Don't laugh.

"Simulated farm" itself emphasizes experience and neglects target. Even playing as a pure game is a very good work. For those players who are immersed in "having fun with people", this slow-paced game is obviously not suitable for them. For those players who are used to eating big fish and big meat and want to change their tastes, it's a fresh and endurable "bite" "Xiangtang" is not a suitable choice.
