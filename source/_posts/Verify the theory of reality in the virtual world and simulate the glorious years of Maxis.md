When I was still at school, I usually had a habit of running to the audio-visual area of the mall not far from home after school to see if there were any new games. At that time, there was a game that left a deep impression on the author, not because of how excellent the game was or how attractive the theme was, but because there were almost all different versions of the game on the shelves at that time. The author didn't know that there were documentaries and supplementary packages, but simply thought that this game was not the only one There are many versions, and the number is amazing.

When it comes to Maxis, many people may not have a more intuitive impression, and if you have played "Sims" or "Sims city" from their hands, you are equal to knowing the unknown company. In this era of "endless fun to fight with people", the game of fighting and killing seems to be able to arouse the nature and desire of the players, with "extermination" and "victory" as the main core. However, the work of Maxis company is exactly opposite. He encourages the players to "create" and "operate" to make them unique in the whole game industry.

#A gamer of Architecture
Well Wright was born in Georgia in 1960. He has the same name as his father. When he was a child, he was very addicted to making models. According to his father, he enjoyed the feeling of making and creating things. It was his hobby that deeply influenced his future life. During his college years, will successively entered three universities. In the first two years, he was at Louisiana State University. After two years, he transferred to Louisiana Polytechnic University. His interest led him to study architecture and mechanical engineering. After two years at Polytechnic University, he went to the New College University in Manhattan, new York for one year. In these five years, through studying and learning the theories of different classmates, will has a different vision on the cognition of things, but in addition to learning, his favorite thing is no longer a robot, but a video game. Because of the emerging of the game industry in the 1980s, in its view, the interaction ability between video games and people is far more than that of robots, and can present more states, so he decided to join a new field with his own knowledge.

Will Wright
Will Wright's first game is called "raiding bagreen bay", which is a flying shooting game overlooking the corner and landing on Commodore 64, a popular PC platform. However, the rise of the video game industry has made many people have an idea. Although the performance of the game itself is OK, but because of the rampant piracy, the income is affected. Will's first game is not successful Not a failure, but at least he proved to the world that he can make a decent game. As for playing games, will has not forgotten to learn. Shortly after the first game was released, he became fascinated with Jay Forrest's urban dynamics theory, such as urban planning, traffic construction, etc. combined with his previous experience in developing video games, he preferred to use these theories in the development editor to produce virtual scenes to verify these theories, and was making them On the way, will realized the problem: it seems to be a little bit interesting. It's better to make this thing into a game. Someone will like it.

# chance coincidence
Will modified the editor he used for self entertainment to make a decent game, named Sim City, and decided to sell it on Commodore 64 platform again. But Broderbund, the developer who worked with will before, was no longer willing to help him release the game, because the game didn't win or lose in the traditional sense, or even There is no end, so the game that can't play the end will not be liked by the developers. What if nobody sells it? In 1987, will met Jeff Braun, the investor who wanted to enter the game industry, at a party. They both liked Commodore 64 and had a topic. Will introduced his simulation city to him. Jeff was very optimistic about the game and decided to support it. They jointly founded Maxis company. Will plans to improve and strengthen his game, and make versions of multiple platforms to try to log in as many game platforms as possible, and finally it was released in 1989.

1989 simulation city
At first, the game didn't cause much sensation. As those publishers said, there are not many players who pay attention to the game, and the sales growth is very slow. Coincidentally, the game has been appreciated by time magazine of the United States. It introduces the game in a single page and editors' opinions and comments on the game, most of which are positive. The influence of time magazine is indisputable. Although it only has one page, it really ignites the game industry, making the simulation city become the leader of the industry in an instant. Game sales suddenly exploded in a short period of time, known as one of the most influential games in history, and will Wright, who created the game, is also known as one of the "Godfathers of video games" of the year. But based on the success of simulation city, will also found the core of game development that may be really suitable for himself, namely "simulation (SIM)" and "creation". So he decided to develop more simulation games. One of his ideas during his student period had the opportunity to practice: everything can be regarded as an abstract "model".

# simulate everything
Subsequently, the company launched SimEarth, which can observe the evolution of life by changing the climate and environment, and simant, which can simulate the ecology and habits of ants to help their expanding forces to achieve self-defense, and simfarm, which has the same playing method as the simulation city, but is smaller but complete, and other works. Even now, the creativity of these works is very novel. In will's own opinion, these works have some experimental properties, but these works can't copy the success of "simulated city". However, will is worth doing the same for "simulated city". Who makes the design of this work have theoretical support? As far as the overall quality is concerned, the leading elder brother of "simulation city" is definitely the best one.

1993 simulation farm
After several years of polishing and improvement, analog City ushered in his sequel. At that time, almost all products like to add "2000" after their names, so this work is also called "analog city 2000" naturally. Although the name is followed by a 2000, there were almost six years left in 2000. The picture of this work has been changed from a vertical top view angle to a 45 degree top view angle with more details, which has greatly improved both in the picture, the system and the content, making the ecology and operation in the city closer to the reality. The unexpected big sale of this work has also become the work of many modern players. Since then, a variety of game content expansion packages have emerged in endlessly, from furniture to architecture to script printing. This is the beginning of Maxis becoming a DLC maniac. But will's ambition is not only there, they want to simulate many things, which can accept everything in the world, or even "life".

1994 simulation city 2000
# the Millennium Finale
The period from 1995 to 1997 can be said to be a low period for Maxis. After the launch of "simulation city 2000", Maxis also tried to launch many more novel game styles, such as "simulation building", "simulation helicopter", "simulation Park" and many other works. Although each work is full of interest, compared with "simulation city", it's a bit of a small family These themes are almost all included in the simulation city. At the same time, "simulation helicopter" and the subsequent "simulation city street" as a driving simulation game, due to the unfamiliar with this type of game, the screen and system design are relatively backward, which is also a trial work of Maxis trying to develop 3D screen works, so the performance effect is very poor, far behind the same period of similar works. For a variety of reasons, the sales volume of these works is not ideal, and the introduction of too many works in a short period of time also makes Maxis lack inspiration, and even the internal finance is still a little nervous. In order to continue playing games, the company has to start to seek help from a gold owner.

1996 simulation helicopter
In 1997, Maxis was acquired by American EA company for us $125 million. Ironically, Maxis and bullfrog, another well-known simulation business, were irreconcilable rivals. Now they are all under EA's control and become "allies" in a special way. After entering EA, in EA's view, the golden signboard of Maxis at that time was only "simulated city", so Maxis was asked to produce another new work, and this work also sounded the clarion call for Maxis to enter a new era. At that time, integrity was close to the new millennium, so this play should be called "simulated city 2000", but this name has been used, so what should we do? Simply add 1000, which is called "simulation city 3000".

1999 simulation city 3000
This work is only completed in one year, but it is amazing in detail. Although the picture is still 2D, Maxis has designed four views in different directions for each unit, which makes the game architecture be able to switch multiple angles for the first time. Although the finished product of the game is hard to be convincing. It's a work completed in only one year. It's highly certain that it can't match the previous work, but it's undeniable that he has indeed recovered the reputation of the company, and 5 million sets have temporarily stabilized his foothold in the new era.

#  "create your own story"
However, this well-made game does not involve Will Wright. At the same time, he is busy with other things: will got inspiration from the early years' production of "simulated ant". Since he can reproduce an animal's micro ecology in the game, why can't he be a human micro society? We can maximize the perspective of simulation city, this time focusing on the tiny but indispensable existence of the city: people. Thus, the Sims, which simulates the lives of civilians, was born. It's not so much a simulation game as a "family friendly" work. Players can create their own simulators in the game, who are responsible for taking care of all aspects of their food, clothing, housing and transportation. But we need to know what the simulation game of Maxis from the universe to the insects needs, and why is it so popular? Some people give the answer: Although Maxis' works have many themes, this one is the most vivid one.

2000 simulation life
After all, this time the game will bring players into the game, from managing cities to caring for simulated people, from macro to micro, from fraternity to specialization, so it can enable players to substitute more feelings. Compared with the original simulation business, the play method of simulation life is more like a leisure game. Players can build their own simulation people at will, or help the simulation people to dress up their home decoration freely to meet their daily needs, so that they can make money from their honest work and start their own business, or they can make trouble everywhere. The highly customized system and very comfortable playing method make this work gain nearly half of the female players in the overseas market, which is not hard to understand. After all, a game of changing clothes can attract numerous players, and the cultivation system contained in "simulation life" is not only changing clothes, it can be said to meet the psychological needs of female players to a large extent.

In will's view, no matter what games the players are playing, it is a process of creating a story. Even though sometimes the players follow the plot's guidance to make a choice, how to make a choice is still up to the players. Will just magnifies the feeling of creating a story and gives the players more rights to make their own choices. In many people's view, this approach In many other games, for example, the game is open-source or provided with MOD or editor to encourage players to create on their own. In SIMS, these contents are completely made into the game, which is undoubtedly more intimate and friendly to the people than open-source. There are quite a lot of documentaries in SIMS. There are seven documentaries in the first generation of the series, and the price of each one is not cheap. Even at the end of the series, a version integrating all documentaries will be sold again, which makes Maxis officially become a DLC maniac.

DLC quantity and price of Sims 3
#Flying to the universe
So far, Sims has launched four orthodox works and countless derivative works, and the number of supplementary packages is countless. Although players are reluctant to buy one after another, they can't help buying one. Sims has also become one of the best-selling game works under EA, and the sales volume of the whole series can be comparable to my world. Since the company's products are all available on a large scale or a small scale, will is thinking of creating a large-scale product. This time, they want to restore the whole process of a species from birth to reproduction and then to the establishment of civilization in a game, and the species will start to grow from the single cell stage, and even be able to broadcast their civilization to the whole universe in the later stage. This is an unprecedented grand idea. In 2005, will announced his work demonstration at the developer conference. In this game, players can customize the foreign trade and characteristics of species, and upload the customized foreign trade to the network to share with others. The game will contain a considerable number of stars for players to explore freely in the later space stage, It can be said that the final stage is the beginning of the game.

The demo screen of the game in 2005 (it's a long time ago, I can't find a clearer source)
The game called "spore" took more than three years to develop. In order to fill the gap, Maxis even launched a new "Sims 2" which also contains more than ten documentaries. By 2008, when the game was officially launched, its own content was indeed as will showed at that time. There were five stages in the game, including cell, biology, tribe, civilization and space. But the first four stages of the game had a very short process and low playability. In the last stage of space, there were endless planets, but the playing method was very boring It's not even as interesting as the very short stages of the previous processes. The creativity and design ideas of the game itself naturally have no problem, and the media also give a very objective medium and high evaluation for the work, but it seems that players' expectations for the work are too high, resulting in a huge gap, so the reputation of the work in the players' group is not good, but in the final analysis, it has nothing to do with the game itself.

Spores, 2008
    concluding remarks  
This scene seems to be a familiar one. Players' disappointment with "spore" has led to will Wright's own scolding. However, wilwright did not choose to face it positively, but could not bear the pressure of public opinion. He left Maxis one year after the release of "spore" and even left the game industry strictly. For him, it seems that his creation The industry also reached a bottleneck, so it decided to retreat to the second tier and focus on the concept of "simulation" into daily life. Without will's Maxis, it's like a kite with broken line, without traction and goal. Their next works "dark spore" and "simulation city 5" failed to achieve good results because of their very bad game experience. After a while, EA announced that it would close Maxis headquarters, and only kept the SIM, the development group of "simulation life" based in the same area as ea headquarters S studio "and continue to launch the series" Sims ".

It seems that Maxis, who has created countless splendors, is gone forever, but the classic works he brings to players will be remembered forever. Today, there are still many players who stick to the city or cottage they created many years ago, just as there are many people immersed in "heroes of the magic gate invincible 3". For them, it's not only because of their excellent quality, but also because they carry too many memories left in those years, and this beautiful memory is not It can be replaced at will through innovation.
