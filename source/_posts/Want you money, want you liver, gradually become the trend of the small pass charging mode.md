On September 10, 2019, the wild escort ol finally ushered in a new round of major version updates, adding three different professions for players to choose, so that players can finally have extra things to do besides the confrontation mode, and these professions are relatively interesting. At the same time, a game service called "Wheeler Lawson club" has been updated in the game, which allows players to get experience value by participating in various activities. After accumulating a certain amount of experience, they can get various rewards free of charge.

In addition to this free update service, players can also purchase an upgrade service named "the outside pass" by paying for an extra currency named "gold bar" in the game, which allows players to get an additional experience reward route, and can also accumulate experience to get additional reward content. This seemingly novel operation mode is not the first one created by the developer Rockstar, but it's amazing that R-star has also begun to operate in this mode called "battle pass".

#The third payment revolution
"Battle pass" is called "battle pass" in Chinese. This name may not be unfamiliar to the players in the regular mixed e-game circle. This charging mode first appeared in MoBa game "dota2". When the annual International Invitational Tournament (TI) begins, this kind of "battle pass" or "warrior warrant" or "interactive" will be launched in the play The upgrade service of "guide" is also known as "Ti notebook".
The purpose of launching this service is to raise competition bonus for Ti competition. Every consumption of players in Ti book can raise 25% bonus for competition. At first, players can predict the trend of competition through this book. The more people they buy, the richer the reward, which means "crowdfunding". Later, there is a rule of thumb in the book. Each level has different rewards. Players can not only spend more money to buy a higher level book, but also gain experience by doing tasks to upgrade the book. In short, if they buy a book, they will have to spend money as well as explode the liver. Usually most dota players will recharge the notebook for the reward attached to the high level of the notebook. For them, the content of these periods is directly proportional to the money they pay. I have to say that G Pang will still make money.

When it comes to the game that really promotes this charging mode, it is a group of black horses that no one thought of: Escape Game "Fortress night" produced by epic. The big escape mode of Fortress night is also a free game, but different from dota2, players can accumulate experience value of two rewards at the same time when playing for free. Free players can only obtain one of them named "silver", but also accumulate experience for the reward of "gold". Every player who buys a pass can obtain all previous experience The accumulated "gold" rewards are quite attractive for every player who has invested a lot of time in the game.
You know, the pass price in Fortress night is not high, but at that time, fortress night was in the most popular period, the number of players broke new highs repeatedly, and this kind of reward measure is very attractive. As long as some people are willing to pay out, they can make a lot of money for the game, and more people are willing to pay out than anyone imagined Much more, epic also made a lot of money, and the success of Fortress night is also known in the industry as "the third payment Revolution (the other two are the length and buyout system and the props charging system)", which makes many manufacturers see red.

The items you can get after you pay are very rich
Very soon, the charging mode was spread like the infectious disease in the game field. Almost all the mainstream games with internal charges were added to this service, especially in the field of hand travel. The representative of Finland game company Supercell, the tribal conflict and the Royal war, joined the two category named "gold / Royal family". Token's passport service has enabled the game to create a new revenue record after years of operation, with revenue increasing by 155% in just one week.
The design of supercell's pass is the same as that of Fortress night, but it has made some adjustments according to its own setting of being a mobile game and playing more leisure. It is more like a disguised member service, but the proportion of pass mode is larger. Looking back, many domestic manufacturers, such as "King's glory" and "peace elite", have the same charging mode. However, the pass price in these games is relatively high. They do not adjust according to the style of supercell at all, nor have the conscience of "Fortress night", but directly refer to the mode of paying purchase level in "dota2" Charge.

# the difference between a thousand times for one person and a thousand times for one person
Why is it just a simple change of charging mode that can make the game so profitable? In fact, the mystery is very simple. Although there are many games charged with props in the domestic market, they have become popular in other countries in recent years. No matter at home or abroad, most of the game works with internal purchase elements are usually not very cheap in the impression of players, and the cheap content has no substantial impact on the experience itself, so they are playing for free There is usually a polarization in the play, either heavy krypton tycoon or zero krypton saltfish. The appearance of pass mode means that the overall charging standard of the game will be reduced, thus making the payment threshold of the game lower. After all, not all players' spare money is so abundant. Therefore, lowering the threshold will also give many shy players a choice.

Hierarchical membership is something many players don't want to see
On the other hand, a large part of the reason why fortress night is so successful lies in its unique design of pass, which enables players to have a more intuitive understanding of what they can get. At the same time, there is no "pay 2 win" element in these contents, which are basically some ornaments and props that can only modify the appearance. The design of the pass can make all paying players stay on the same level. There is no difference between high and low. All the things that the players who pay for the pass get are the same. It's just that who is more diligent to complete the task. Under this design, even the players who don't have any desire to pay usually can't help but appear, which makes the per capita consumption obvious After all, the increase of the game's income is not only achieved by a few rich tycoons or player traffic, but also by making every player have the desire to pay for the game itself. In this way, there will be no dispute about krypton gold in the past for the players.

Glory war order
    concluding remarks  
In contrast, the pass used in the ol of the big escort in the wilderness can be called very conscientious. After all, the gold bars needed to buy the pass can be obtained through multiple channels in the game, and the price of the pass itself is not very expensive. It can be said that this time is a real compromise. After all, since the ol of the big escort has been online, the risk assessment has been bad, and the charging content is not good Over pricing has also been criticized by players. It can be seen that R star still has a lot of hope in this game. I hope that with this wave of "pass" wave, we can get a better future.
