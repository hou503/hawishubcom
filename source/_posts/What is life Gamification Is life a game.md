But I don't know if you notice that we don't know when our mobile wallet has an additional "points ranking". Wechat will record your steps every day. Even the take out app often has small games that can win red envelopes. From a certain point of view, these contents seem to be "playing games" with people around you, which is not the same It's a kind of illusion, but our daily life is becoming "Gamification".
#What is Gamification?  
Take the most typical example. As early as 2016, Alipay APP added a function called ant forest, which gained energy through daily consumption and walking steps, while stealing other people's energy from other people's forests and accumulating these energies. You can grow small trees in their "forests" into big trees and grow to a certain level. After that, Alipay will plant a real tree in the northwest under the name of the user.
In essence, this is a public welfare activity that promotes low-carbon and environmental protection, but in a comprehensive way, this activity is actually a very simple social games, and its purpose is to make a less attractive thing "interesting".

In short, the so-called "Gamification" refers to the application of design ideas that often appear in video games to fields other than games. This concept is not emerging recently, but the concept of "Gamification" itself is earlier than the appearance of names. There are many examples that have been used in real life, such as the above ones. Now they mainly appear in most life apps.
Of course, it's not only a game that can make an activity into a real game. For another example, a friend of the author goes back to a fast-food restaurant around his home every Thursday to buy hamburgers. The activity of this fast-food restaurant is to "buy any drink, send photos of the activity newspaper to the circle of friends and buy three hamburgers for ten yuan". People can see this activity clearly It is nothing more than using the interpersonal relationship of customers to promote their own stores, but in essence, it is also a type of "Gamification".
# characteristics of Gamification
Whether it's video games or game products, no matter what type they are, they will have several same characteristics.
We all know that no matter in any video game, it will give the player a goal, so that the player has the motivation to play. The first characteristic of Gamification:   target.  
Different types of games provide different goals for players, such as competitive games to pursue victory, leisure games to pass the time, social games to broaden people, or RPG Games to gain benefits.
Game products are no exception. Take my friend's hamburger as an example. The goal of the game is to buy three hamburgers for ten yuan. The goal of the game is to allow customers to buy high-priced goods at a lower price. But before that, customers need to take action. This is the second feature of game: the   rule  .

No one can resist the joy of explosive equipment
As the saying goes: there are no rules, not a circle. Since ancient times, any form of entertainment needs rules. Rules are a behavior reference in the game process. If there are no rules, there will be a situation where cheating is not uniform. When we were young, we often played a game of "gathering Qi and generating waves". However, there was no uniform rule in this game. Therefore, the situation like "why do you gather Qi to generate waves and I die, but I gather Qi to hit you and you don't die" happened from time to time. "Buy any drink, take photos of posters and send them to friends circle" is the rule of this game. So if we also buy drinks and take photos, we can show this dynamic to the waiter and have the qualification to buy hamburgers, and this dynamic is the third feature:   feedback  .

As we all know, in video games, the element of "strike sense" is a very metaphysical existence. The quality of "strike sense" varies from person to person. In different games, the response given by a slash on the enemy is also different. The "feedback" we have to say is not so metaphysical. For example, in CS, when someone shoots you, you can know how much blood you have lost. This is the feedback. It can be the information users need in the game, or the records of various behaviors of players. Taking photos and sending friends circle is like a task in the game. After sending, your task is finished. This dynamic is your proof.

There is such a ramen shop downstairs of the author's house. Its slogan is: "it's better to eat one thousand times than one thousand times". The natural way to do business is to hope that your business can always be patronized. Similarly, the success of a game depends on whether it can retain players. In the past traditional RPG Games, we need better equipment to fight against powerful boss, while equipment needs to fight against monsters to explode. When you collect the equipment and defeat boss, you find that you need to fight against stronger boss, and you think that you need better equipment, so you fall into a cycle Players stick to their own games.
As for the above situation, even in such a favorable situation, if the hamburger is not delicious, the customer will not come again; and if the hamburger is delicious, plus such a high discount, it will give the customer a "value for money" feeling, so that the customer will come next time, and this is the last standard of the game products:   encouraging  . Combined with these features, it's not hard to know why some people think it's interesting to throw paper balls into the basket.

If it's not fun to throw paper balls, why are there games?
