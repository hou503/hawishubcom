French Ubisoft's annual 3A masterpiece "ghost action: breakpoint" has finally been released. Before its release, Ubisoft has spared no effort to put advertisements on various websites and commissioned many well-known video podcasts for publicity. Even in China, we can see many advertisements. Even many players who haven't played this game may have heard of this game Name.

Ubisoft did not provide the media with the first version of the evaluation this time, that is to say, all foreign media and players are games played on the same day, and the media's evaluation of excellence is lifted one by one after the sale of the game. However, the evaluation of the game is not ideal, and most of the scores are still hovering at the passing line, until Now, the average media score of this work has fallen below the passing line, and the player's score is even worse than qingyishui's. it seems that this new work of Ubisoft really makes the players unbearable.

#What's the problem?
I was lucky enough to be selected to participate in the beta test of breakpoint. After all, as a series fan who directly bought the golden version of the previous work ghost action: wilderness, this opportunity will not be missed. Although the former work wilderness has been criticized by the players for a long time, and there are many problems in my opinion, I have experienced all the contents of the game completely and completely. Generally speaking, I can only get a general evaluation. At the same time, as a landscape party, Bolivia's beautiful scenery can be the bonus of this work. The right is to The lowest cost is a self-help tour in Bolivia, which is also worth the game money.

Ghost action: Wilderness
In the test of breakpoint, even as a fan, the author didn't think how excellent the work was. Many people said that the beta test was the beginning of the experience game body, and the shaping and design of this part was quite good, but it made people feel that this generation has integrated the RPG element, that is, the popular "kill the strange and drop the equipment" , and as a tactical shooting game with emphasis on semi simulation, maybe this is the most unsuitable design for the "ghost action" series. Let's put the combination of tactical shooting and RPG aside. Let's talk about what else caused the players to be so angry. IGN, a well-known overseas media, scored a temporary score of 7 points for breakpoint on the day of its release, and gave such a comment: there are many progress systems in breakpoint that allow players to get rewards no matter what they do in the game, and the scenery in the game is also enjoyable. Players can defeat enemies in a completely free way when facing enemies in a stronghold.

Ign provisional score
If the players who have played the previous work wilderness may feel a smile when they see this evaluation, which means that the game experience of this work is not much different from that of the previous work wilderness. What can be played in the beta test, even in the later stage of the official version, is also these contents, which is one of the biggest problems of this work: familiar "The flavor of Ubisoft", combined with the system design problems mentioned before, the experience of this work is even worse than that of the previous work. According to the player evaluation integrated on foreign media metacritics, not only is it a very familiar taste in the game experience, but also bugs and bad optimization problems that can affect the normal experience of the game in the game keep the "Ubisoft features" as always, even more serious than previous works. Even the fairly high-end configuration will occasionally cause hardware crash. However, as a game with similar or even worse experience than the previous one, its price is much more expensive than the previous one. I believe no one can accept it like this, even if it is "another tour", it's also a bit worrisome.

Metacritical score
#New formula
One might say: isn't this another "formula open world" game of Ubisoft? This is true, but not entirely. Breakpoint is really a "Ubisoft formula game", but this time the formula is not the "formula game" we are familiar with before. From the early days of Assassin's creed, open world, full of map collection elements, a large number of but highly repetitive branch tasks, as well as a story with a sense of substitution that is not too strong or even unclear who did what until customs clearance, all of these elements constitute the game style of Ubisoft in the next few years, no matter in action or shooting games. One advantage of doing so is that the quality of the game will be locked in a horizontal range, which saves effort and time. The factors that can make the horizontal line float are whether the plot is brilliant and whether the game is high enough. The disadvantage of doing so is that all games are playing the same way, so even different categories and IP will soon be boring, and this design will not be able to create a "masterpiece" level game that can rank among the industry benchmarks.

"Assassin's Creed: the great revolution" this map is really scary
In the first few years, Ubisoft's several games suffered from this "formulaic" design. They also realized that they should make some adjustments. The first "mouse" they tested was Ubisoft's latest IP "whole territory blockade" in recent years. This work applies the "Tom Clancy" type of aerial setting, and adds the RPG elements on the basis of the aerial realistic war theme. Although the design of shooting and RPG is not the first one by Ubisoft, the whole territory blockade is undoubtedly the largest and the most refined one in the design of pictures and scenes. "Blockade of the whole territory" has become the best-selling single work of Ubisoft for many years. With various problems encountered in the first launch, the first attempt to MMO online games also highlights their inexperience, but the game is successful, but this seems to make Ubisoft aware of the feasibility of this design, so RPG system seems to be the "golden oil" in Ubisoft's eyes, so Ubisoft also The "new formula" has been found.

RPG numerical design of "whole territory blockade"
In the next few years, "Assassin's Creed: Origin", "Assassin's Creed: Odyssey" and "whole territory blockade 2", all of these games, without exception, have achieved a double harvest of reputation and sales volume (whole territory blockade 2 is set off by peers to some extent). When it was released, "origin" was even evaluated as "another peak work of Assassin's Creed many years later", so we do not It's hard to see that the combination of various categories and RPG system has formed a new chemical reaction. The previous "formula design" has been removed some elements, and at the same time, it is open to accept the RPG content. With the addition of RPG elements, not only the playability of the game can be increased, but also the freedom of the game can be improved. Undoubtedly, the design of "striking strange and exploding clothes" and talent and skills are in the process at the same time There are many weaknesses of players. These contents are the source design that can bring "pleasure" and "play impulse" to players. In addition, these IPS are also suitable for making RPG Games, so it is expected that they will succeed.

Assassin's Creed: origin
However, the best match is always the best match for experiments. The ghost action, which is mainly about stealth tactical shooting, is obviously not as good as RPG. "Ghost action" emphasizes that many people can cooperate in tactics, such as "synchronous shooting" and role division. Even if there is no online player, there are also AI teammates to provide assistance, which is one of the core of the series for many years. In breakpoint, if not online, only the player is alone. Although RPG element is introduced in breakpoint, as long as the enemy does not wear a helmet or mask, it is still "dead with a bang", and the delay design of triggering the alarm is very slow. Most of the time, sneaking becomes unnecessary. The previous concept of "tactical shooting" can be thrown away, just aiming at the head It's easy.

So where does the RPG element stand out? As the author said above, "kill the strange equipment", players need to check the items column to replace new equipment, but in fact, no matter what gun is shot dead, so the RPG equipment design becomes meaningless. In short, the ambition of breakpoint is very strong. They have integrated a lot of content into this work, but finally made a "four not like" out, which not only lost the characteristics of the original "ghost action", but also did not have any other characteristics that can be highlighted, resulting in offending the old players, and the new players have no desire to try.

Concluding remarks
In contrast, wilderness, which was not well-known at the beginning, has become a masterpiece, which is ironic. The quality of the game is so bad. I'm sorry for the huge publicity and the expensive price of the game. Just like the original whole territory blockade, Ubisoft imagines everything is too good. They think that the players will perform the dark zone drama in the promotional film, but in fact, there are only endless killing and being killed. So is breakpoint, such as life The introduction of storage system and RPG system, but in the game, these designs are virtual. They view their games with high expectations, but the players are not as naive as he imagined.
