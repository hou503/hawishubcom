Looking at the current 3A stand-alone works, it seems that with a huge map of the open world has become a standard configuration. We can explore the world through various ways provided in the game, and at the same time, we can do anything we want to do. For example, in the action game GTA, we can loot other passers-by's vehicles at will, try to parachute between the buildings in the city, and drive the tank to bomb the streets. For the players, this kind of play is enough to let them fly.

But many people can feel that although they can explore at will in these mainstream open world games and can do a lot of things, it seems that players can experience the game at will, but in fact, the freedom that can be provided for players in the game is far from being called "freedom".
We may recall that in most open world games, they are usually divided into "task state" and "roaming state". When undertaking tasks, most of the games can only be played according to the requirements given by the tasks, but the games that we really want to play at will can only be played outside the tasks. However, if we don't do the tasks, we can't advance the process of the game. So it seems that the Can the feeling of "leading the nose" really be called "freedom"?
#How to define high degrees of freedom?  
The freedom of a game depends on the self orientation of the game. Take racing game as an example. If the playing method of the game is always a traditional racing game that only brushes circles in a fixed field, then obviously there is no freedom in the game. But if it is an open map, a race can not only drive smoothly according to the route, but also can break away from the open world racing game of how fast and how to open the track, then the freedom of the latter is obvious However, it is higher than the former; if on this basis, the user-defined modification system and collision system are added to allow players to install rain tires to the vehicle in sunny days, or directly crash the opponent to gain an advantage for themselves, then the playability can be upgraded to a higher level.

It's true that it's OK to make a game with the first orientation, but compared with these examples, it's obvious that the design of the last one should be more attractive. The playing method of racing game is nothing more than the posture vehicle flying on the road, neither flying nor launching, and if a game is made according to the above design, it can also be called "high degree of freedom". All in all, the definition of freedom is not how open the game world is, but how many "options" can be provided to players. In terms of loading rain tires on a sunny day, it's obviously meaningless to do so. Naturally, players will not be encouraged to do so in the game. However, the game only provides players with such conditions and gives them the right to choose. Whether or not to do so is completely the "freedom" of players, which is the expression of high degree of freedom.

Let's take another look at other types of games on the market. Take action games for example. As mentioned above, most open world action games are seemingly free, but in fact, your every move is under the control of the game. For example, in GTA, when you do a task, you will be asked where to go, what to do, and how to do it. Players will always follow the guidance of the task, and if you don't, the task will fail. Although the design of these tasks is wonderful and comparable to a blockbuster, all these are planned by the developers. The only free option provided by the game for the players is to choose what vehicles and routes they can take when they go to the task location.

GTA and its core lie in its wonderful task design and plot performance, which creates a high immersion experience for the players, while the content outside any task is only the core foil. Think carefully, the world of GTA is like a patchwork of many large and small linear checkpoints, because their story needs such a big world, so they did so In a big world, GTA's freedom is not high.
# which games are considered as "high degree of freedom"?  
With the most easy to understand explanation, the so-called "high freedom game" is "a game with many choices". One might ask, are text adventures or interactive movie games with only text or options free enough? When we dissect these games, the options provided to players in these games are all pre-designed processes by developers. Even though there are many kinds of options, they are still not separated from the developers' planning. Therefore, the simple choice is not "high degree of freedom". Of course, "choice" is not only reflected in the explicit aspect of letting players do the choice, but also in combination with different factors The type of game to determine the level of freedom.

My favorite ARPG game "horse riding and killing" is a game with high degree of freedom. The game provides a rather complex character growth system for the players. What kind of character they want to become depends on the players' own orientation. At the same time, the mission system of the game is very weak. If there is no "script" (game system, you can design the game stream by yourself In the case of Cheng), there are almost no tasks to talk about. Players can be soldiers who want to become stronger, or bandits who commit crimes everywhere. The whole game world is players' playground, and they can play as they want. When they grow up to a certain extent, the whole game mode becomes a simulation operation or even a strategy game, which leads soldiers to attack cities To be a king of a country is not a dream.

The same design is also reflected in many old American RPG Games and nostalgic CRPG games, such as "door of Bode", "radiation", "divine kingdom" series, etc. these games also promote the game process by completing tasks, but usually only give players a goal, and how to do it needs players to explore.
For a simple example, you need to get a prop. The prop is locked in a room, and the key of the door is on an NPC. That's all the information. You can choose to bribe NPC to give you the key, or kill NPC to get the key, or try to pry the door open, or smash the door directly, or even use props and skills to transfer yourself directly to the room. There are so many ways to carry out such a simple task, but the game will never provide suggestions and Guidance, how to proceed is entirely up to the player to choose.

    concluding remarks  
There are many other games like this. I won't go over them one by one here. All these games have a common player because their system is deep enough to encourage the players to think independently, which is incomprehensible for the players who are used to playing simple and direct rough games. For them, deep thinking is a kind of torture.
This also reflects a phenomenon from the side: why do teenagers have rebellious period? One of the main reasons is that the elders give too few choices, sometimes even only one way to choose. This kind of rebellion, though not respected, can be understood, because the pursuit of diversity of choice is human nature, but also the nature of all creatures. From an evolutionary point of view, it's because of the diversity of choices that life blooms such colorful fireworks.
