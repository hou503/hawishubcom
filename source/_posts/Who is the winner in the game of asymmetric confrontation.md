In today's mainstream competitive games, it is usually 5v5 mode. Only a few games may be 6v6 or even many. The biggest advantage of both sides of the competition using the same number of people is fairness. After all, for competitive games, there is nothing more important than fairness. With the passage of time, people's thinking began to diverge, the mode of competitive games became more and more mature, and the topic was shifted back to the number of opponents.

It has been assumed that if the number of confrontations is changed to one to many, but at the same time this person is given the ability to equal the number of the other party, then this is a different form of balance. In this way, the game concept of "asymmetric confrontation" was born. And the games derived from this concept have begun to appear in the game market one after another. Although they are very novel and interesting, few works seem to maintain strong vitality.
# rules that already exist
In fact, the game rule of asymmetric confrontation is not just emerging in recent years, and it was not originally used in the field of video games, but was born in the military field. In 1991, a report called "joint operations of the armed forces of the United States" proposed a form of "asymmetric operations", which refers to the use of different forces on both sides of the battle, such as air force to Navy, air force to army, army to Navy, etc., which are unbalanced in information, capability or combat resources and utilized during the war Environmental elements are the effect of "arms restraint" for our side, so as to occupy more advantages and reduce the consumption of resources. Asymmetric operations emphasize flexible rules of engagement, organization, operational theory or equipment to implement operations safely and effectively.

It is the same in the field of games. The resources of both sides are not functional, and their interaction mode, rules and ultimate goal are totally different. The concept of non confrontation has been used in the field of games for a long time. For example, the most popular and popular chess and card game "fight the landlord" is the mode of asymmetric confrontation. One of the three players is the landlord, and the other two are the peasants. ; one of the two peasants can take the lead in escaping the cards in hand and win, and the two peasants can win with mutual help; the landlord can get additional cards to help him form a better card type and more efficient escape card. The former relies more on individual ability, while the latter relies more on team work.

    misunderstanding
In fact, it is not that there is only a difference in the number of people on both sides, even if it is an asymmetric confrontation, the number of people is only one of the elements in the asymmetric game, and there are many asymmetric games that do not have a difference in the number of people. Many SLG games on the mobile platform usually adopt the game playing method of building and cultivating. Players need to build their own camp while cultivating their forces. The forces are used to attack other people's camp to obtain more resources to build the camp. The purpose of building the camp is to resist the invasion of other players. The mode of the game breaks down. In essence, it's a 1v1 game. The attackers need to arrange troops to try to break through, while the defenders need to try their best to resist the attacks of the attackers. Although the number of players is the same, the game modes of both sides are quite different. Different ways of playing mean different ideas in the process of the game. The attackers can choose to attack at any time and how many troops to attack, while the defenders can only be prepared before the battle begins.

In addition to the differences in game mechanism, there are also differences in game rules, such as the "cart" mode in "Legion Fortress 2" and "watch the vanguard", which is also based on the same number of players. One side of the cart only needs to drive other enemies to the target point to win, while the defense side needs to do its best to block the progress of the other side and stick to the turn time End. In contrast, like the SLG game mentioned above, the average battle time and frequency of the defensive side in a round are much higher than that of the offensive side, so it is obviously not fair to rely on only one round to determine the victory and defeat. It is necessary to join multiple rounds at a time, and the positions of the two sides also need to be exchanged between each round, so that both sides have the possibility of scoring, even if they swim The rules of the play are asymmetric in themselves, but on the whole they are quite fair.

# lessons from the past
Although there are not many game works adopting this concept, it is precisely because of this that each of these games is catchy. The representative work in the early years has created the anti terrorist elite ol with "biochemical upsurge" for the following FPS online games. The biochemical mode contained in ol is a model of asymmetric confrontation. The players' life value is very low and the damage is not high, but the number of players is large and they can use firearms, while the infected ones are high in damage, but the number of people is small and they can only use melee attack. In most cases, an infected person can transform a survivor into an infected person with only one stroke. Therefore, the rule of the game is that the infected person will transform all the survivors, or the survivors will kill all the infected persons. In this condition, the cooperation between the survivors is more and more needed. Otherwise, under such harsh conditions, the whole army will be easily annihilated.

Later, there are many one-to-many horror survival games on the market, such as "dawn killing machine", "Friday the 13th" and "the fifth personality". Because it is a terror game, the core of the game is not fighting but survival. The survivors just need to escape the monster as soon as possible, while the players who play the monster have different abilities to cope with it These survivors are not so much a survival game as a "hide and seek" game (the later hide and seek mode is the same). The author would like to focus on a piece of work here. He was once called "the pioneer of asymmetric confrontation game" by players. Unfortunately, the game has stopped serving now. Although he tried to save the situation, he failed to avoid the fate of death. This game is evolution.

Evolution is a 3A level multi player online asymmetric confrontation FPS game produced by turnlerock studio and released by 2K. In the process of the game, one player plays a monster and four players play a hunter to fight. Monsters have no ability to compete with four hunters at the same time in the early stage, so they need to constantly devour other small animals to strengthen their own evolution, so that they can grow from a small monster to a big monster, and whoever is defeated first will lose. It seems that the game itself has an excellent system and playing method, but the real fatal element is the balance of the game. The players who play four hunters have different roles and occupations, so the whole game needs four players to cooperate closely. If the team is organized, the threshold of the game will rise to a stage. After all, not everyone can easily master the playing methods of four different occupations, so the fault tolerance rate of hunters will become low, and the game experience of the team is very poor. In most cases, passers-by players are all Unable to open voice to communicate with each other, thus forming a rather bad game environment, thus dissuading one player after another.

    concluding remarks  
Even though evolution was later changed to free operation, it still failed to solve this problem fundamentally. To be clear, it was because the game's playing method was too novel and lacked all-round consideration and design. However, the failure of evolution inspired many later common games. Instead of fighting each other, it was better to directly remove the fighting elements, which made these later residents The games on have all been successful. However, even now, if a non adversary game does not have continuous and stable content update and balance adjustment, then its own playing method is relatively simple, and asymmetric confrontation is likely to die at any time.

The failure of evolution is enough to explain everything, and there are few games that can really do this, which is why this mode has not been able to fully fire. This is a very potential game model that needs to be improved and developed. I hope to see more excellent game works in the future.
