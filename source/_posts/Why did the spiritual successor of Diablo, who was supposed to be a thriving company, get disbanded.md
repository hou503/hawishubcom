Ten years ago, independent games were in a period of rapid development. Many well-made creative and novel works came out in the upper class of the market, and it was also the most popular period of independent games. There were also relatively excellent and topical works on the market. In my early years, I loved Blizzard's many works, especially Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3. However, Diablo 2 has been the game of 2000. People always expect Blizzard to publish the new works of Diablo as soon as possible.

At this time, an independent game called "torch light" appeared in the vision of the players. At first glance, it has excellent quality. The developer of this game, runic games, was founded by the original "father of darkness". He also participated in the development of this game. With this name as a signboard, this game soon became a black horse in 2009. In principle, since the company has such a good reputation, the game should sell well, and the company should have a lot of money, but it's amazing that the company was dissolved two years ago, leaving only their works for later players to continue to enjoy.

#  "we're going to do Diablo."
Players who know something about Blizzard should know that in the early years, blizzard had an external studio named flagship, which was specially responsible for developing various high-quality games. Most of Blizzard's works were developed by them, while Diablo series was full name operated by them. Without them, there would be no Diablo Achievements now. Unfortunately, due to the rising development cost of the game over time, and the lack of awareness of authenticity among players in the early years, the talented studio had to close down due to economic problems. The internal members of the studio are divided into several teams, and the members of each team have established relatively good feelings and tacit understanding with each other. When the studio announced its closure, they were also at a loss, and one of the teams, Travis baudrilly, was unwilling to separate from his colleagues, so they once again gathered 14 people in the team and established runic games together with Max scayf, the "father of darkness".

After the establishment of the new studio, the company didn't have a clear goal for about two months. Now that the game studio has been set up, how can we say that we should continue to play games? At that time, they were already independent studios, so what kind of game to play became a puzzle for them to think about. After several discussions, they decided to make an ARPG similar to Diablo, which is what they are good at. At the same time, they also want to make another such game. Considering that there has been no such kind of works for a long time since Diablo 2, and the random map system which plays a great role in Diablo 2 rarely reappears They decided to polish all the highlights and advantages they thought of when they made Diablo 2, and try to make a better quality work. This work is the light of the torch of the early generation, and it took only 11 months to make a very good demo.

#The light of the torch
Only years of cooperation experience can make this not too large team to produce such a high degree of completion in such a short time. For the development of this game, the members of the whole team have reached a complete consensus, which is the so-called "work hard and think hard". However, no matter how complete the game is, it can't be called "official version". After all, it's still a demo. There's no way, because their capital has bottomed out. What they need now is not to continue to find ways to polish the game, but to find a investor to relieve the economic pressure as soon as possible. At this time, the game has been released to the Internet to start "preemptive experience" 。
They have visited big fish, a leading us EA company, and even Microsoft, which makes gambling games, but they are all turned away for various reasons. Compared with their games, they want the talents of this studio. At the same time, perfect world (also called perfect time and space at that time) was a free asset of domestic manufacturers. They needed more technical support to operate different games. So they took a fancy to runic, understood their situation, and bought most shares of runic at a price of 8.4 million dollars. Finally, they were able to complete and release the official version of torch light.

After its release, "torch light" soon reached a million level of sales due to its high completion and game quality. The world has not interfered too much with the independent research and development of runic, but as a technical support, they are still needed to help improve their other games. Runic has been planning to make an MMO like "light of the torch", but at present their ability can not achieve this ambitious goal, so they can only temporarily put it on hold. As they had money on hand, they took advantage of the heat to make a more complete sequel to the torch light. During this period, the host port of the first generation works was also taken over, so the light of the torch 2, which could have been released as soon as possible, could not be postponed. The players who have an impression should also remember that the second generation had a ticket jump. In 2012, "torch light 2" is just in front of the newly released "Diablo 3". It's hard to imagine that it's a work made by an independent game team, and it's true in front of "Diablo 3".

# 《Hob》
The success of torch light 2 has made runic one of the first-line development teams. In the next few years, runic has been trying to make a new game. They have a lot of inspiration and want to make a science fiction style game, but although the idea is very good, because the new plan failed to be recognized by all members of the studio, they know that if they can't be like before "Light of the torch" is like "trying to make it work in one place". It is likely that the quality of the game will be unsatisfactory. Most members of the team are very fond of the adventure game like legend of Zelda in their early years, so this time they no longer try their own unique skill of "random generation", but intend to make a complete linear game, which is similar to Zelda, but also want to integrate their unique style. In this trend of thinking, a new game is born A new IP called hob.

Although runic wants to make a game similar to Zelda, he doesn't want to make it too similar at the same time, so there is no reference object for the development of this game, and all needs to be tried by the development team from scratch, and the game has been changed again and again. In the end, "hob" became an action adventure game, and its growth system was more like an action game than an RPG game.
The game was released at the end of September 2017. The development team didn't provide much publicity for this work. Instead, many media publicized it with "the latest work of the torch light development team". Many players thought it would be a kind of dark ARPG game. As a result, the quality of the game itself was acceptable, but there were many defects due to the immature experience in many aspects. Therefore, the game played The sales volume of the play is not good, and runic has invested too much in the game, so that this time it failed to obtain the revenue in direct proportion to the payment. The development of the game took five years in total, but the final product was not in direct proportion to their five-year payment. This time, even the perfect world could not be saved. It was expected that runic would be disbanded So this time, it's really because of runic's slip, which leads to everlasting hatred.

    concluding remarks  
Fortunately, after the dissolution of runic, most of the members cooperated with some practitioners of another studio, gearbox, and re established the new studio, Monster Squad games. They learned from the failure of runic. They believed that for the independent game development team in today's era, if a game wants to create long-term revenue, it needs to be long-term The game is updated and improved, and the game is operated in the form of similar online games. After the dissolution of runic, the IP of torch light was naturally handed over to the perfect. Perfect planned to hand over this IP to another studio and complete the MMO of torch light that runic had always wanted to do but failed to do.

In 2018, "torch light: front line" was officially released, and it is expected to have an opportunity to sell this year. According to the experience of foreign media line, it seems to give this game a very high evaluation, claiming that this is the best online design for the same type of ARPG works. I hope this game will bring surprises to the players in the future, and I also hope that the newly established monster square can be operated for a long time this time.
