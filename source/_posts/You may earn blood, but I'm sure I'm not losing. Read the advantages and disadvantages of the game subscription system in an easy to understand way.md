According to the data, in 2018, the highest revenue subscription service in Europe and the United States was Playstation now on Sony PS host platform, with a monthly fee of $20. Although the price is double that of Microsoft Xbox game pass, it still can earn three times of XGP revenue. Throughout the whole game field, more and more manufacturers have started to launch this service, which is going to become the mainstream. For our players, is the game subscription good or bad?
# digital products
Subscription service has been popular in the field of Internet since a long time ago. For example, the "members" we can see on major video websites at ordinary times, as long as we have members, we can get more permissions on video websites, and we can watch more videos only when we pay for them. In the early years, video games only have offline purchase of entities as a channel. With the gradual progress of science and technology, digital games have gradually gained a larger proportion in the game market. After all, although the price of carving a CD-ROM in the early physical games is not so expensive, no matter how much it is to promote, transport, store or even sell, it needs to pay a certain fee, and the cost will inevitably increase Make itself perhaps not expensive game cost multiplied growth. When digital games come into being, most of the cost can be avoided, which undoubtedly reduces the pressure on game manufacturers, and the extra money can also be used in other places.

Gamestop, a famous foreign game retailer, has closed many stores
Now the network level has begun to enter the 5g era, the network speed and quality have increased nearly ten times compared with the previous, and the significance of the existence of physical games is further weakened. Imagine that a game with a capacity of about 10g can be installed on your game device in just a few minutes or even seconds after it is paid. In the face of a physical version with the same or higher price, offline running or paying extra transportation costs, it is estimated that most people will choose the former. Let's turn our thinking around for a moment and think about it. As a player, we only need to pay a small amount to experience hundreds of game works and even the newly launched 3A masterpieces. These games can sell at a higher price than the original ones. Isn't this a loss business for developers?

#Why does   have subscription system?  
From the perspective of developers, there is no difference between games and other real goods on the shelves, but at the same time, the biggest difference between games and real goods is that there is no substance, since there is no substance, there will be no "consumption" phenomenon. The author gives an example, for example, someone spent a little money to set up a member in a cosmetics store. One of the members' privileges is that you can try all the products of the company without limit, so this person goes every day and consumes the products every day, which is undoubtedly a loss for the business. But this will not happen to video games, because video games are not substantive things, and paid subscription services can only exchange the right to use the game instead of the right to own it. This is like renting a game in the past. Although you only need to pay the rent and don't need to pay the deposit to get the game, the condition without the deposit is that you can only play the game under the whole supervision of the network. When the time comes, you lose the game's play authority. If you want to play next, you need to continue to pay, or directly buy the game in full, which is removed for the business There is almost no loss beyond the cost of developing games, and a profit can be made by the way.

Apple arcade game subscription service
It seems that choosing the game subscription service is actually very profitable. You only need to pay a little money to experience hundreds of games, but in a limited time, how many games can players really fully experience? After all, you can't play these hundreds of games at the same time. Maybe you are really good at spending a lot of time and clearing customs quickly. But if you play the game just to rush through customs, what's the meaning of the game itself? In the view of players, subscription service may be blood earning, but for businesses, it is absolutely not a loss, and the blood earning is definitely businesses rather than players. In fact, it's a very simple truth. If this service doesn't earn money, what's the need to launch it? And how can so many manufacturers adopt this marketing mode?

#What do the insiders think?  
In the game related industries, most people support subscription services. After all, even the cheapest buy-out game is not as good as it used to be. Many players often feel regret after buying the game, so they want to refund. Refund is always a thankless job, which is time-consuming, laborious and not profitable. As a developer, it is natural to try to avoid this situation. The subscription system can solve this problem well. This game is not fun. If you change it, you don't need to experience all the content in one breath, so it's not easy to regret the players. This kind of feeling is like the former gives a bucket of chocolate to the players. Although they are addicted, they can't eat it all at once. How to eat too much will make them sick. The control of the quantity depends on the players themselves. The latter is like giving a bucket of chocolate to the players little by little every day. It's neither painful nor itchy. Although it's not addictive, it's better than nothing, but it can't be pointed out that one day it suddenly disappears and looks good It makes people feel uncomfortable.

Sony Playstation now game subscription service
There is a consensus among relevant people: Although Sony's PS now service is a long way ahead of other manufacturers, there is no doubt that Microsoft's XGP is the most dedicated existence for developers and players, and its price performance is far higher than all subscription services.

#Conclusion
There is no doubt that the game subscription system will be a major trend in the future, whether it is the platform or the manufacturer has already put into action or is still planning.

Although this is a good thing for developers, it can't guarantee that it's a good thing for players. As mentioned above, players are bound to pay attention to a certain game lineup to choose consumption in the future, but who can guarantee that in the future, there will not be those players who make up a lot of money in this mode.
